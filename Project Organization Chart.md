# Description
A graphic display of [[team member]]s and their reporting relationships.

It can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the [[project]].

For example, the [[Project Organization Chart]] for a 3,000-person disaster response team will have greater detail than a [[Project Organization Chart]] for an internal, 20-person project.
