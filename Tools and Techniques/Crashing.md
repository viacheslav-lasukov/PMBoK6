# Description
[[Schedule Compression]] technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding [[Resource]]s.

Crashing works only for activities on the [[Critical Path]] where additional [[Resource]]s will shorten the activity's duration.

Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in increased risk and/or cost.
## Examples
- Approving overtime
- Bringing in additional [[Resource]]s
- Paying to expedite delivery to activities on the [[Critical Path]]

## Comparison with [[Fast Tracking]]
