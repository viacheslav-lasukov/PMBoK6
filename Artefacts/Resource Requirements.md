# Description
Identifies the types and quantities of resources required for each [[Work Package]] or activity in a [[Work Package]] and can be aggregated to determine the estimated resources for each [[Work Package]], each [[Work Breakdown Structure]] branch, and the project as a whole. The amount of detail and the level of specificity of the resource requirement descriptions can vary by application area. The resource requirements‚Äô documentation can include assumptions that were made in determining which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.
