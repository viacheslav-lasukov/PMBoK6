# In Adaptive Environments
- Adaptive projects revisit and revalidate the project charter on a frequent basis.
- As the project progresses, competing priorities and changing dynamics may cause the project constraints and success criteria to become obsolete. For this reason, the Initiating processes are performed regularly on adaptive projects in order to ensure the project is moving within constraints and toward goals that reflect the latest information.
- Adaptive projects rely heavily on a knowledgeable customer or designated customer representative who can state needs and desires, and provide feedback on the emerging deliverable on a continuous, ongoing basis. Identifying this stakeholder or other stakeholders at the start of the project permits frequent interactions when performing Execution and Monitoring and Controlling processes. The associated feedback ensures that the correct project outputs are delivered.
- Initiating process is typically conducted on each iterative cycle.
