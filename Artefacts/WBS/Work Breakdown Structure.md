# Description
Hierarchical [[decomposition]] of the total scope of work to be carried out by the [[Team]] to accomplish the [[Objective]]s and create the required [[Deliverables]].

Each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of the work.
## Example
![[Sample WBS Decomposed Down Through Work Packages.png]]
## Structuring Ways
- Using **phases** of the [[Project Life Cycle]] as the 2nd level of [[decomposition]], with the [[deliverables]] inserted at the 3rd level
  ![[WBS Organized by Phase.png]]
- Using **major [[deliverables]]** as the second level of [[decomposition]]
  ![[WBS with Major Deliverables.png]]
- Incorporating **subcomponents** that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as contracted work. The [[Seller]] then develops the supporting [[Agreement|contract]] WBS as part of the contracted work
