# Description
One of the [[Procurement Documentation]].

Once the [[make-or-buy analysis]] is complete and the decision is made to **acquire from outside the project**, a [[procurement strategy]] should be identified.

The objective is to determine:
- project [[#delivery methods]]
- [[#Contract Payment Types|type of legally binding agreement(s)]]
- how the procurement will advance through the [[#Prcurement Phases]]
## Delivery Methods
| For professional services | For industrial or commercial construction |
| --- | --- |
| - [[Buyer]]/services provider with no subcontracting<br>- [[Buyer]]/services provider with subcontracting allowed<br>- joint venture between [[Buyer]] and services provider<br>- [[Buyer]]/services provider acts as the representative | - turnkey<br>- design build (DB)<br>- design bid build (DBB)<br>- design build operate (DBO)<br>- build own operate transfer (BOOT) |
## Contract Payment Types
Are coordinated with the buying organization's internal financial systems.
- **Fixed-price** contracts are suitable when the type of work is predictable and the requirements are well defined and not likely to change
- **Cost plus** contracts are suitable when the work is evolving, likely to change, or not well defined
- **Incentives and awards** may be used to align the objectives of [[Buyer]] and [[Seller]]
## Procurement Phases
Information about phases:
- Sequencing or phasing of the procurement, a description of each phase and the specific objectives of each phase
- Procurement performance indicators and milestones to be used in monitoring
- [[Criteria]] for moving from phase to phase
- Monitoring and evaluation plan for tracking progress
- Process for [[Knowledge Transfer]] for use in subsequent phases
