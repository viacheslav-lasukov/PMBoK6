## #pmbok6
A [[Project Life Cycle]] where the [[Project Scope]] is generally determined early in the [[Project Life Cycle]], but time and cost estimates are routinely modified as the [[Team]]'s understanding of the [[Product]] increases.

[[Iteration]]s develop the [[Product]] through a series of repeated cycles, while [[increment]]s successively add to the functionality of the [[Product]].
