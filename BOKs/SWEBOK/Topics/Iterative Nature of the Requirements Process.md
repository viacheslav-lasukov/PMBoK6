SWEBOK_KA: "[[Software Requirements]]"
---
It is always impractical to implement the requirements process as a linear, deterministic process in which software requirements are elicited from the stakeholders, baselined, allocated, and handed over to the software development team.

It is certainly a myth that the [[requirement]]s for large software projects are ever perfectly understood or perfectly specified.

Instead, [[requirement]]s typically iterate towards a level of quality and detail that is sufficient to permit design and procurement decisions to be made.
