# Description
Enhances brainstorming with a [[Voting]] process used to rank the most useful ideas for further [[Brainstorming]] or for [[Prioritization (Ranking)]].
## Steps
1. A question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas.
2. The moderator writes down the ideas on a flip chart until all ideas are recorded.
3. Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding.
4. Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1‚Äì5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round, the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected.
