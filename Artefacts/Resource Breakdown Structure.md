# Description
A hierarchical list of team and physical [[Resource]]s related by category and [[Resource]] type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project work.

Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the [[Resource]] until the [[Information]] is small enough to be used in conjunction with the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] to allow the work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.
