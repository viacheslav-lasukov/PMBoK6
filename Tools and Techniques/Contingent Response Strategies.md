# Description
Some [[Risk Responses]] are designed for use only if certain events occur.

For some [[Risk]]s, it is appropriate for the [[Team]] to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan.

Events that trigger the [[Contingency]] response, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a [[Seller]], should be defined and tracked.

Risk responses identified using this technique are often called [[Contingency]] plans or [[Fallback Plan]]s and include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.
