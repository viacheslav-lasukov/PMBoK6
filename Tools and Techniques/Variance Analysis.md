# Description
Reviews the differences (or variance) between planned and actual performance. This can include [[Duration Estimates]], [[Cost Estimates]], resources utilization, resources rates, technical performance, and other metrics.

May be conducted in each #knowledge-area based on its particular variables.
## In [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]]
The explanation (cause, impact, and corrective actions) for cost ([[Cost Variance|CV]] = [[Earned Value|EV]] ‚Äì [[Actual Cost|AC]]), schedule ([[Schedule Variance|SV]] = [[Earned Value|EV]] ‚Äì [[Planned Value|PV]]), and [[Variance at Completion]] ([[Variance at Completion|VAC]] = [[Budget at Completion|BAC]] ‚Äì [[Estimate at Completion|EAC]]) variances.
## Includes
### [[Schedule Variance]]
A measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference between the [[Earned Value|EV]] and the [[Planned Value|PV]]. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind the planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It is equal to the [[Earned Value|EV]] minus the [[Planned Value|PV]]. The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] schedule variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the [[Planned Value|PV]]s will have been earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with [[Critical Path Method]] scheduling and [[11 Risk Management|Risk Management]]. Equation: [[Schedule Variance|SV]] = [[Earned Value|EV]] ‚Äì [[Planned Value|PV]].
### [[Cost Variance]]
The amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed as the difference between [[Earned Value|EV]] and the [[Actual Cost|AC]]. It is a measure of cost performance on a project. It is equal to the [[Earned Value|EV]] minus the [[Actual Cost|AC]]. The [[Cost Variance|CV]] at the end of the project will be the difference between the [[Budget at Completion|BAC]] and the actual amount spent. The [[Cost Variance|CV]] is particularly critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative [[Cost Variance|CV]] is often difficult for the project to recover. Equation: [[Cost Variance|CV]] = [[Earned Value|EV]] ‚Äì [[Actual Cost|AC]].
### [[Schedule Performance Index]]
A measure of schedule efficiency expressed as the ratio of [[Earned Value|EV]] to [[Planned Value|PV]]. It measures how efficiently the project team is accomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the [[cost performance index]]  to forecast the final project completion estimates. An [[Schedule Performance Index |SPI]] value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than was planned. An [[Schedule Performance Index |SPI]] greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the [[Schedule Performance Index |SPI]] measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine whether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The [[Schedule Performance Index |SPI]]is equal to the ratio of the EV to the PV. Equation: [[Schedule Performance Index |SPI]] = [[Earned Value|EV]] / [[Planned Value|PV]].
### [[Cost Performance Index]] 
A measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources, expressed as a ratio of [[Earned Value|EV]] to [[Actual Cost|AC]]. It is considered the most critical [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] metric and measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A [[cost performance index|CPI]] value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun for work completed. A [[cost performance index|CPI]] value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The [[cost performance index|CPI]] is equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: [[cost performance index|CPI]] = [[Earned Value|EV]] / [[Actual Cost|AC]].
