# Key Concepts
- Project [[Resource]]s include both **physical [[Resource]]s** (equipment, materials, facilities, and infrastructure) and **team [[Resource]]s** (individuals with assigned project [[Roles and Responsibilities]]).
- Different skills and competences are needed to manage team [[Resource]]s versus physical [[Resource]]s.
- The project manager should be both the **leader** and the **manager** of the project team, and should invest suitable effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and empowering team members.
- The project manager should be aware of team influences such as the team environment, geographical location of team members, communication among stakeholders, organizational change management, internal and external politics, cultural issues, and organizational uniqueness.
- PM should be aware of aspects that influence the team:
	- Team environment
	- Geographical locations of team members
	- Communications among stakeholders
	- Organizational change management
	- Internal and external politics
	- Cultural issues and organizational uniqueness
	- Other factors that may alter project performance.
- As a leader, the project manager is responsible for proactively developing team skills and competences while retaining and improving team satisfaction and [[motivation]].
- Physical [[Resource]] management is concentrated on allocating and utilizing the physical [[Resource]]s needed for successful completion of the project in an efficient and effective way. Failure to manage and [[Control]] [[Resource]]s efficiently may reduce the chance of completing the project successfully.
- Failing to manage and [[Control]] [[Resource]]s efficiently is a source of risk for successful project completion:
	- Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the final [[Product]],
	- Ordering low-[[Quality]] material may damage the [[Quality]] of the [[Product]] causing a high rate of recalls or [[Rework]],
	- Keeping too much inventory may result in high [[Operation]]s costs and reduce the organization's profit. Unacceptably low inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying [[Customer]] demand and, again, reduce the organization's profit.

# Trends and Emerging Practices
- Shift away **from a command and [[Control]] toward collaborative and supportive management approach** that empowers teams by delegating decision making to the team members.
- **[[Resource]] management methods**. Due to the scarce nature of critical [[Resource]]s, in some industries, several trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about [[Lean]] management, [[just-in-time manufacturing]], [[Kaizen]], [[Total Productive Maintenance]], [[Theory of Constraints]], and other methods. A [[project manager]] should determine if the [[Performing Organization]] has adopted one or more [[Resource]] management tools and adapt the project accordingly.
- **[[Emotional Intelligence]]**. The [[Project Manager]] should invest in personal [[Emotional Intelligence|EI]] by improving inbound (e.g., self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team [[Emotional Intelligence|EI]] or become an emotionally competent group are more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.
- **[[Self-Organizing Team]]s**. The increase in using [[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given rise to the [[Self-Organizing Team]], where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects that have [[Self-Organizing Team]]s, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful [[Self-Organizing Team]]s usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of [[Subject Matter Expert|SME]]s, who continuously adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.
- **[[Virtual Team]]/distributed teams**. The challenges of managing virtual teams:
	- possible feeling of isolation
	- gaps in sharing [[Knowledge]] and experience between team members
	- difficulties in tracking progress and productivity
	- possible time zone difference
	- cultural differences
# [[Tailoring]] Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Diversity | What is the diversity background of the team? |
| Physical location | What is the physical location of team members and physical [[Resource]]s? |
| Industry-specific resources | What special [[Resource]]s are needed in in the industry? |
| Acquisition of team members | - How will team members be acquired for the project?<br>- Are team [[Resource]]s full-time or part-time on the project? |
| Development and management of team | - How is team development managed for the 
project?<br>- Are there organizational tools to manage team development or will new ones need to be established?<br>- Will the team need special training to manage diversity? |
| Life cycle approaches | What life cycle approach will be used on the project? |
# In [[Agile Life Cycle|Agile]] Environments
- [[Self-Organizing Team]]s with generalizing specialists.
- Collaborative teams may:
	- facilitate accelerated integration of distinct work activities
	- improve communication
	- increase [[Knowledge Sharing]]
	- provide flexibility of work assignments
- Agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to controlling costs and achieving the schedule.
