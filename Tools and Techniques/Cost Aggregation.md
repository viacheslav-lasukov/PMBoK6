Description: "[[Cost Aggregation#Description|📝]]"
---
[[Cost estimates]] are aggregated by [[Work Package]]s in accordance with the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]].

The [[Work Package]] [[cost estimates]] are then aggregated for the higher component levels of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] (such as [[control account]]s) and, ultimately, for the entire [[Project]].
