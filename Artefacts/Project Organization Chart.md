# Description
A graphic display of [[Team]] members and their reporting relationships.

It can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the [[project need]]s.

The [[Project Organization Chart]] for a 3,000-person disaster response team will have greater detail than a [[Project Organization Chart]] for an internal, 20-person project.
