# Description
A predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to [[Individual Project Risk]]s and that could also act as sources of [[Overall Project Risk]].

Can be used as a framework to aid the [[Team]] in idea generation when using [[11.2 Identify Risks|Risks Identification]] techniques.

The risk categories in the lowest level of the [[risk breakdown structure]] can be used as a prompt list for [[Individual Project Risk]]s.

Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of [[Overall Project Risk]]:
- PESTLE — political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental
- TECOP — technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political
- VUCA — volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity
