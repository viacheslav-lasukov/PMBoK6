# Description
Identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities.

Distinguishes time periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not available for work.

A [[schedule model]] may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the project schedule.

The project calendars may be updated.
