# Description
Total funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the [[cost baseline]]. The [[cost baseline]] will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in incremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed.

The total funds required are those included in the [[cost baseline]] plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include the source(s) of the funding.
