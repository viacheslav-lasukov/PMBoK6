# Description
Cost estimates are aggregated by [[work package]]s in accordance with the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]. The work package cost estimates are then aggregated for the higher component levels of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] (such as [[control account]]s) and, ultimately, for the entire project.
