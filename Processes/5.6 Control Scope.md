# Description
Monitoring the status of the project and [[Product Scope]] and managing changes to the [[Scope Baseline]]. Ensures all requested changes and recommended corrective or preventive actions are processed through the [[4.6 Perform Integrated Change Control]] process. It is also used to manage the actual changes when they occur and is integrated with the other [[Control]] processes. The uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and [[Resource]]s is referred to as [[Scope Creep]]. Change is inevitable; therefore, some type of [[Change Control]] process is mandatory for every project.
## Key Benefits
[[Scope Baseline]] is maintained throughout the project.
