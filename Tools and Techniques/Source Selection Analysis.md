# Description
It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands for the [[project]] before deciding on the selection method.

Since competitive selection methods may require [[seller]]s to invest a large amount of time and resources upfront, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in the [[Procurement Documentation]] so bidders know how they will be evaluated.
## Selection Methods
| Method                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Least cost**                                     | Is ppropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where well-established practices and standards exist and from which a specific and well-defined outcome is expected, which can be executed at different costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Qualifications only**                            | Applies when the time and cost of a full selection process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The [[buyer]] establishes a short list and selects the bidder with the best credibility, qualifications, experience, expertise, areas of specialization, and references.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Quality-based/highest technical [[proposal]] score** | The selected firm is asked to submit a [[proposal]] with both technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the [[Agreement|contract]] if the technical [[proposal]] proves acceptable. Using this method, technical proposals are first evaluated based on the quality of the technical solution offered. The [[seller]] who submitted the highest-ranked technical [[proposal]] is selected if their financial [[proposal]] can be negotiated and accepted.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Quality and cost-based**                         | The quality and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a factor in the [[seller]] selection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are greater for the project, quality should be a key element when compared to cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Sole source**                                    | The [[buyer]] asks a specific [[seller]] to prepare technical and financial proposals, which are then negotiated. Since there is no competition, this method is acceptable only when properly justified and should be viewed as an exception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Fixed budget**                                   | The fixed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget to invited [[seller]]s in the RFP and selecting the highest-ranking technical [[proposal]] within the budget. Because [[seller]]s are subject to a cost constraint, they will adapt the scope and quality of their offer to that budget. The [[buyer]] should therefore ensure that the budget is compatible with the SOW and that the [[seller]] will be able to perform the tasks within the budget. This method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely defined, no changes are anticipated, and the budget is fixed and cannot be exceeded. |
