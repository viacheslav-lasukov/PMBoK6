# Description
The act of collecting and distributing [[project information]].

[[Project information]] is distributed to many groups of [[stakeholders]] and should be adapted to provide information at an appropriate level, format, and detail for each type of stakeholder.

The format may range from a simple communication to more elaborate custom reports and presentations. 

Information may be prepared regularly or on an exception basis.

While [[work performance report]]s are the output of the [[4.5 Monitor and Control Project Work]] process, the [[10.2 Manage Communications]] process develops ad hoc reports, project presentations, blogs, and other types of communication about the [[project]].
