# Key Concepts
- Project Integration Management is the specific responsibility of the project manager and it cannot be delegated or transferred. The project manager is the one that combines the results from all the other Knowledge Areas to provide an overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible for the project as a whole.
- Projects and project management are integrative by nature, with most tasks involving more than one Knowledge Area.
- The relationships of processes within the Project Management Process Groups and between the Project Management Process
- Project Integration Management is about:
	- Ensuring that the due dates of project deliverables, the project life cycle, and the benefits realization plan are aligned;
	- Providing a project management plan to achieve the project objectives;
	- Ensuring the creation and the use of appropriate knowledge to and from the project;
	- Managing project performance and changes to the project activities;
	- Making integrated decisions regarding key changes impacting the project;
	- Measuring and monitoring progress and taking appropriate action;
	- Collecting, analyzing and communicating project information to relevant stakeholders;
	- Completing all the work of the project and formally closing each phase, contract, and the project as a whole; and
	- Managing phase transitions when necessary.

# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Project life cycle | - What is an appropriate project life cycle?<br>- What phases should comprise the project life cycle? |
| Development life cycle | - What development life cycle and approach is appropriate for the product, service or result?<br>- Is a predictive or adaptive approach appropriate?<br>- If adaptive, should the product be developed incrementally or iteratively?<br>- Is a hybrid approach best? |
| Management approaches | - What management processes are most effective based on the organizational culture and the complexity of the project? |
| Knowledge management | - How will knowledge be managed in the project to foster a collaborative working environment? |
| Change | - How will change be managed in the project? |
| Governance | - What control boards, committees, and other stakeholders are part of the project?<br>- What are the project status reporting requirements? |
| Lessons learned | - What information should be collected throughout and at the end of the project?<br>- How will historical information and lessons learned be made available to future projects? |
| Benefits | - When and how should benefits be reported: at the end of the project or at the end of each iteration or phase? |
