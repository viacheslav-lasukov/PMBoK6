Provides a direct way of viewing individuals in their [[environment]] and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes.

Helpful for detailed processes when the people who use the [[Product]] have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their [[requirement]]s.

Done externally by an observer viewing a business expert performing a job.

Can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden [[requirement]]s.
