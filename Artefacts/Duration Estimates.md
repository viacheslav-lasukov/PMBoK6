# Description
Quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete an activity, a phase, or a project.

Lags are not included.

May include some indication of the range of possible results:
- A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12 (assuming a 5-day work week)
- A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take 3 weeks or less.
