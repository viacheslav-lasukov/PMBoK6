# Description
Focus groups bring together prequalified [[stakeholders]] and [[subject matter expert|SMEs]] to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview.
