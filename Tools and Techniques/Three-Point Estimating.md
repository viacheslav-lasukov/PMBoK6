# Description
## For Schedule
$tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3$
- Most likely ($tM$). This [[Estimate]] is based on the duration of the activity, given the [[Resource]]s likely to be assigned, their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and interruptions.
- Optimistic ($tO$). The [[Activity Duration]] based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
- Pessimistic ($tP$). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
## For Cost
Triangular distribution. $cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3$
Beta distribution. $cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6$
- Most likely ($cM$). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any predicted expenses.
- Optimistic ($cO$). The cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
- Pessimistic ($cP$). The cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
