# Description
A grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that allow [[individual project risk]]s to be divided into priority groups. Risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts. The probability of occurrence for each [[individual project risk]] is assessed as well as its impact on one or more [[Objective]]s if it does occur, using definitions of probability and impact for the project as specified in the [[Risk Management Plan]].
