# Description
Helps to determine which [[individual project risk]]s or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on [[Project Outcome]]s.

Correlates [[Variation]]s in [[Project Outcome]]s with [[Variation]]s in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.

One typical display of [[sensitivity analysis]] is the [[Tornado Diagram]], which presents the calculated correlation coefficient for each element of the [[Quantitative Risk Analysis Model]] that can influence the [[Project Outcome]]. This can include [[individual project risk]]s, project activities with high degrees of variability, or specific sources of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance. ![[Example Tornado Diagram.png]]
