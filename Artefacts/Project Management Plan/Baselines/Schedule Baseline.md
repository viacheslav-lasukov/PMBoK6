# Description
The component of the [[Project Management Plan]].

The approved version of a [[schedule model]] that can be changed only through formal [[Change Control Procedures]] and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During [[Monitoring and Controlling]], the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances have occurred.
