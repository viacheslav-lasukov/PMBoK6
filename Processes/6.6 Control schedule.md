# Description
Monitoring the status of the project to update the [[Project Schedule]] and managing changes to the [[Schedule Baseline]].
## Concerned With
- Determining the current status of the [[project schedule]]
- Influencing the factors that create schedule changes
- Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves
- Determining if the [[project schedule]] has changed
- Managing the actual changes as they occur
## In Agile Approach, Concerned With
- Determining the current status of the [[project schedule]] by comparing the total amount of work delivered and accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle
- Conducting [[retrospective]]s (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving
- Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog)
- Determining the rate at which the [[deliverables]] are produced, validated, and accepted ([[velocity]]) in the given time per iteration (agreed-upon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month)
- Determining that the [[project schedule]] has changed
- Managing the actual changes as they occur
## Key Benefits
The [[schedule baseline]] is maintained throughout the project.
