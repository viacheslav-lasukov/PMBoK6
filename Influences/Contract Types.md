| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Fixed-price** | Involves setting a fixed total price for a defined [[Products, Services, Results]] to be provided. | - requirements are well defined<br>- no significant changes to the scope are expected | **Firm fixed price (FFP)** | The most commonly used [[Agreement]] type. It is favored by most buying organizations because the price for goods is set at the outset and not subject to change unless the scope of work changes. |  |  |
|  |  |  | **Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)** | Gives the [[Buyer]] and [[Seller]] some flexibility in that it allows for deviation from performance, with financial incentives tied to achieving agreed-upon metrics.<br><br>Financial incentives are related to cost, schedule, or technical performance of the [[Seller]].<br><br>A price ceiling is set, and all costs above the price ceiling are the responsibility of the [[Seller]]. |  | - If the project is completed after the date, the price shall be (X).<br>- If the project is completed earlier than that date, the price shall be (X + 5%X). |
|  |  |  | **Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA)** | Significant increases or decreases in a commodities cost may be considered as an economic factor that adjusts the price. | - whenever the [[Seller]]‚Äôs performance period spans a considerable period of years (economic factor is **inflation**)<br>- if the payments are made in a different currency of the agreed currency (economic factor is **exchange rate**) |  |
| **Cost-Reimbursable** | Involves:<br>- payments (cost reimbursements) to the [[Seller]] for all legitimate [[Actual Cost]]s incurred for completed work<br>- fee representing [[Seller]] profit | -¬†Work has an evolving nature not fixed (e.g., services and operating)<br>-¬†Work requirements are not well defined<br>-¬†Work is likely to change (due to absence of strategic planning, inflation, new demands from authorities, etc.) | **Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)** | [[Seller]] receives:<br>- reimbursement for all allowable costs for performing the [[Agreement]] work<br>- fixed-fee payment calculated as a percentage of the initial estimated project costs<br><br>Fee amounts do not change unless the [[Project Scope]] changes. If the [[Project Scope]] changes, the current CPFF to be replaced by a revised CPFF. |  | - Estimated project costs (before contracting) = 1,000<br>- Fixed-fee ratio (agreed in the [[Agreement]]) = 15%<br>- Fixed-fee payment shall be = 15% √ó 1000 = 150<br>- Actual incurred cost (after project completion) = 1,100<br>- Client shall pay = 1,100 + 150 = 1,250 |
|  |  |  | **Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)** | [[Seller]] receives:<br>- reimbursement for all allowable costs for performing the [[Agreement]] work<br>- predetermined fixed-fee payment based on achieving certain performance objectives as set forth in the [[Agreement]]<br><br>If the final costs are less or greater than the original estimated costs, then both the [[Buyer]] and [[Seller]] share costs from the departures based upon a prenegotiated cost-sharing formula, i.e., an 80/20 split over/under target costs based on the actual performance of the [[Seller]]. |  | - The estimated project costs (before contracting) = 1,000<br>- The fixed-fee ratio (agreed in the [[Agreement]]) = 15%<br>- The fixed-fee payment shall be = 15% √ó 1000 = 150<br>- The over/under target costs is (agreed in the [[Agreement]]) = 80% Client / 20% Contractor.<br><br>Over target case:<br>- The actual incurred cost (after project completion) = 1,200$<br>- The client shall pay = 1,200 + 150 - 20% √ó (1,200 - 1,000) = 1,310<br>- The [[Seller]]'s profit = 1,310 - 1,200 = 110<br><br>Under target case:<br>- The actual incurred cost (after project completion) = 900<br>- The client shall pay = 900 + 150 + 20% √ó (1,000 - 900) = 1,070<br>- The [[Seller]]'s profit = 1,070 - 900 = 170 |
|  |  |  | **Cost plus award fee (CPAF)** | [[Seller]] receives:<br>- reimbursement for all allowable costs that incurred to perform the [[Agreement]] works<br>- fee earned based on the satisfaction of certain broad subjective performance [[Criteria]] that are defined and incorporated into the [[Agreement]]<br><br>The determination of fee is based solely on the subjective determination of [[Seller]] performance by the [[Buyer]] and is generally not subject to appeals. |  |  |
| **Time and material (T&M)** | aka "time and means"<br><br>Is a hybrid type with aspects of both **cost-reimbursable** and **fixed-price**.<br><br>[[Buyer]] agrees to pay to [[Seller]] for the:<br>- time spent by the [[Seller]]‚Äôs employees and equipment to perform the work<br>- materials used in performing the work<br><br>Pricing the time and the material can be by **fixed-price** or by **cost-reimbursable**.<br><br>May include an agreed price limits:<br>- max price ‚Äî [[Seller]] won't receive more.<br>- min price ‚Äî [[Buyer]] won't pay less. | It is not possible to accurately estimate one or both of the followings:<br>- work size in these projects<br>- when the project requirements would most likely change |  |  |  | - Supervision [[Agreement]]: [[Seller]] supervises, inspects and tests executed works using equipment and consuming materials.<br>- Technical support contracts: SMEs privide consultancy to the [[Buyer]].<br>- Building rehabilitation [[Agreement]]: rehabilitation requires replacing items such as plastering which may uncover a not expected rot or damage that should be treated. |
