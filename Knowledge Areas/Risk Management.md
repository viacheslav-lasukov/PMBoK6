# Key Concepts
- All projects are risky. Organizations choose to take project risk in order to create value, while balancing risk and reward.
- Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not covered by other project management processes.
- Risk exists at two levels within every project: ***Individual project risk*** is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. ***Overall project risk*** is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of risk in projects.
- Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Overall project risk can also be positive or negative.
- Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted iteratively.
- In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Project size | - Does the project's size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed approach to risk management?<br>- Or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process? |
| Project complexity | - Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity?<br>- Or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will suffice? |
| Project importance | - How strategically important is the project?<br>- Is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses significant blocks to organizational performance, or involves major product innovation? |
| Development approach | Is this a waterfall project where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during execution? |
