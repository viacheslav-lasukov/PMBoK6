Description: "[[Claims Administration#Description|üìù]]"

Contested changes and potential constructive changes are those requested changes where the [[Buyer]] and [[Seller]] cannot reach an agreement on compensation for the change or cannot agree that a change has occurred.

These contested changes are called [[Claim]]s.

When they cannot be resolved, they become disputes and finally appeals.

[[Claim]]s are documented, processed, monitored, and managed throughout the [[Agreement|contract]] life cycle, usually in accordance with the terms of the [[Agreement|contract]].

If the parties themselves do not resolve a [[Claim]], it may have to be handled in accordance with alternative dispute resolution (ADR) typically following procedures established in the [[Agreement|contract]].

Settlement of all [[Claim]]s and disputes through [[negotiation]] is the preferred method.
