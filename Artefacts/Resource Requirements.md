# Description
Identifies the types and quantities of [[Resource]]s required for each [[Work Package]] or activity in a [[Work Package]] and can be aggregated to determine the estimated [[Resource]]s for each [[Work Package]], each [[Work Breakdown Structure]] branch, and the project as a whole.

The amount of detail and the level of specificity of the [[Resource]] requirement descriptions can vary by application area.

The [[Resource requirements]] documentation can include [[Assumption]]s that were made in determining which types of [[Resource]]s are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.
