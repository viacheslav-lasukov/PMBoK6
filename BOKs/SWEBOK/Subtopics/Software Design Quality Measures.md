| *Function-based*  | Obtained by analyzing functional decomposition. Generally represented using a structure chart (sometimes called a hierarchical diagram) on which various measures can be computed.                  |
| *Object-oriented* | the design structure is typically represented as a class diagram, on which various measures can be computed. Measures on the properties of the internal content of each class can also be computed. |
