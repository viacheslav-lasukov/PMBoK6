# Description
Graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as dependencies, among the project schedule activities.

Can include full project details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe the basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully described within the narrative.
## Example

## Types of Relationships
- [[Path Convergence]]
- [[Path Divergence]]

Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater [[Risk]] as they are affected by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities.

Activity I is called a [[Path Convergence]], as it has more than one [[Predecessor Activity|Predecessor]], while activity K is called a [[Path Divergence]], as it has more than one [[Successor Activity|Successor]].
