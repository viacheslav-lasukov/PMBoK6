This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for person-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.
## Models
### Basic sender-receiver communication model
Describes communication as a process and consists of two parties, defined as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the message is delivered, rather than understood.
#### Steps
1. **Encode**. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission (sending).
2. **Transmit message**. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of [[Information]] in transmission and/or reception of the message.
3. **Decode**. The [[Data]] received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.
### Interactive communication model
Describes communication as a process consisting of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. Noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message, such as the distraction of the receiver, [[Variation]]s in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate [[Knowledge]] or interest.
#### Steps
1. **Encode**. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission (sending).
2. **Transmit message**. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of [[Information]] in transmission and/or reception of the message.
3. **Decode**. The [[Data]] received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.
4. **Acknowledge**. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message ‚Äî merely that it has been received.
5. **Feedback/response**. When the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been successful. In communication between people, feedback can be achieved through [[active listening]].
## Parties Responsibilities
| Sender | Receiver |
| --- | --- |
| - Transmission of the message<br>- Ensuring the [[Information]] being communicated is clear and complete<br>- Confirming the message is correctly interpreted | Ensuring that the [[Information]] is:<br>- received in its entirety<br>- interpreted correctly<br>- acknowledged or responded to appropriately |

## Cross-Cultural Communication
Challenges:
- Differences in communication styles can arise from differences in:
	- working methods
	- age, generation
	- nationality
	- professional discipline
	- ethnicity
	- race
	- gender
- People from different cultures communicate using different languages (e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols

Message itself and how it is transmitted are influenced by sender's current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases.

The receiver's emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will influence how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.
