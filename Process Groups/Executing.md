# In Adaptive Environments
- Work in agile, iterative, and adaptive project life cycles is directed and managed through iterations. Each iteration is a short, fixed time period to undertake work followed by a demonstration of functionality or design. These sessions also help manage stakeholder engagement by showing increments of work done and discussing future work.
- Based on the demonstration, relevant stakeholders and the team conduct a retrospective review. The demonstration and review helps check progress against the plan and determines if any changes to the project scope, schedule, or execution processes are necessary. The retrospective allows issues with the execution approach to be identified and discussed in a timely fashion along with ideas for improvements. Retrospectives are a primary tool to manage project knowledge and develop the team through discussions of what is working well and team-based problem solving.
- While work is undertaken via short iterations, it is also tracked and managed against longer-term project delivery timeframes. Trends of development speed, spend, defect rates, and team capacity that are tracked at an iteration level are summed and extrapolated at a project level to track completion performance. Highly adaptive approaches aim to utilize specialized team knowledge for task completion. Rather than a project manager selecting and sequencing work, higher-level objectives are explained and the team members are empowered to self-organize specific tasks as a group to best meet those objectives. This leads to the creation of practical plans with high levels of buy-in from the team members.
- Junior teams working on highly adaptive projects typically need coaching and work assignments before reaching this empowered team state.
