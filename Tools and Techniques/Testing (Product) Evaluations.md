# Description
Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective [[Information]] about the [[Quality]] of the [[Products, Services, Results]] under test in accordance with the project requirements.

The intent of testing is to find errors, defects, bugs, or other nonconformance problems in the [[Products, Services, Results]].

The type, amount, and extent of tests needed to evaluate each requirement are part of the project [[Quality]] plan and depend on the nature of the project, time, budget, and other constraints.

Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the [[Project]] become available, and at the end of the [[Project]] on the final [[deliverables]].

Early testing helps identify nonconformance problems and helps reduce the cost of fixing the nonconforming components.
