# Description
Considers the likelihood that a specific risk will occur.

Considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance.

Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities.

Probability and impact are assessed for each identified individual project risk.

Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the [[risk register]].

[[Team member]]s and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included.

The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the [[Interviews]] or meeting.

Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences should be explored.

Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded.

Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the [[risk management plan]].

Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the [[risk register]] as part of a watch list for future monitoring.
