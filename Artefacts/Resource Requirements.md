# Description
Identifies the types and quantities of resources required for each [[Work Package]] or activity in a [[Work Package]] and can be aggregated to determine the estimated resources for each [[Work Package]], each [[Work Breakdown Structure]] branch, and the project as a whole.

The amount of detail and the level of specificity of the resource requirement descriptions can vary by application area.

The [[resource requirements]]’ documentation can include assumptions that were made in determining which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.
