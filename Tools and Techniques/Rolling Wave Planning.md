# Description
Iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration applicable to [[Work Package]]s, [[Planning Package]]s, [[Release Planning]] when using an [[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] or waterfall ([[Predictive Life Cycle|predictive]]) approach. Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the [[Project Life Cycle]]. During early strategic planning when [[Information]] is less defined, [[Work Package]]s may be decomposed to the known level of detail. As more is known about the upcoming events in the near term, [[Work Package]]s can be decomposed into activities.
