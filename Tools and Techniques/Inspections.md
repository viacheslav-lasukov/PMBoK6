# Description
Examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results of **inspections** generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be inspected, or the final product of the project can be inspected. **Inspections** may be called reviews, peer reviews, [[Audits]], or walkthroughs. In some application areas, these terms have narrow and specific meanings. **Inspections** also are used to verify defect repairs.
