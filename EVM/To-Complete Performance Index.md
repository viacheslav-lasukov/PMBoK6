# Description
Is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with the remaining [[Resource]]s in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the remaining budget.

Is the calculated [[Cost Performance Index]] that is achieved on the remaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the [[Estimate at Completion|EAC]] may replace the BAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCPI based on the BAC: $TCPI = (BAC ‚Äì EV) / (BAC ‚Äì AC)$.

The equation for the [[To-Complete Performance Index|TCPI]] is shown in the lower left as the work remaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either the BAC minus the AC, or the [[Estimate at Completion|EAC]] minus the AC).

If the cumulative [[Cost Performance Index|CPI]] falls below the baseline, all future work of the project will need to be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) to stay within the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number of considerations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical performance. This level of performance is displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the  is based on the EAC: $TCPI = (BAC ‚Äì EV) / ([[EAC]] ‚Äì AC)$.
