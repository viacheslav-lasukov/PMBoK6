# Description
A method of categorizing [[stakeholders]] using various methods.

Categorizing [[stakeholders]] assists the [[project team|team]] in building relationships with the identified [[stakeholders]].
## Examples
### Power-Interest / Power-Influence / Impact-Influence Grid
Supports a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of [[Authority]] (**power**), level of concern about the [[project]]'s outcomes (**interest**), ability to influence the outcomes of the project (**influence**), or ability to cause changes to the project's [[Planning]] or [[Executing|execution]]. Is useful for small projects or for projects with simple relationships between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder community itself.
### Stakeholder cube
This is a refinement of the [[#Power-Interest / Power-Influence / Impact-Influence Grid]]. Combines the grid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to [[project manager]]s and [[project team|team]]s in identifying and engaging their [[Stakeholder Community]]. Provides a model with multiple dimensions that improves the depiction of the [[Stakeholder Community]] as a multidimensional entity and assists with the development of communication strategies.
### Salience model
Describes classes of [[stakeholders]] based on assessments of their:
- [[Authority|power]] (level of authority or ability to influence the outcomes of the [[project]])
- urgency (need for immediate attention, either time-constrained or relating to the [[stakeholders]]‚Äô high stake in the outcome)
- legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate)
There is an adaptation of the [[#Salience model]] that substitutes proximity for legitimacy (applying to the team and measuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). Is useful for large complex [[Stakeholder Community|Stakeholder Communities]] or where there are complex [[networks]] of relationships within the [[Stakeholder Community]]. It is also useful in determining the relative importance of the identified [[stakeholders]].
### Directions of Influence
Classifies [[stakeholders]] according to their influence on the work of the [[project]] or the [[project team]] itself. [[Stakeholders]] can be classified in the following ways:
- **Upward** ([[senior management]] of the [[performing organization]] or customer organization, [[Sponsor]], and [[Steering Committee]])
- **Downward** (the [[project team|team]] or specialists contributing knowledge or skills in a temporary capacity)
- **Outward** (stakeholder groups and their representatives outside the [[project team]], such as [[supplier]]s, [[Government Department]]s, the public, end-users, and [[Regulator]]s), or
- **Sideward** (the peers of the [[project manager]], such as other [[project manager]]s or [[Middle Management]] who are in competition for scarce project resources or who collaborate with the [[project manager]] in sharing resources or information).
### Prioritization
May be necessary for [[project]]s with a large number of [[stakeholders]], where the membership of the [[stakeholder community]] is changing frequently, or when the relationships between [[stakeholders]] and the [[project team]] or within the [[stakeholder community]] are complex.
