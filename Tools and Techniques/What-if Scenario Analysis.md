The process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict their effect, positive or negative, on [[Objective]]s. This is an analysis of the question, "*What if the situation represented by scenario X happens?*"

A [[Schedule Network Analysis]] is performed using the schedule to compute the different scenarios:
- delaying a major component delivery
- extending specific engineering durations
- introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process

The outcome can be used to assess the feasibility of the [[project schedule]] under different conditions, and in preparing [[Schedule Reserve]]s and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.
