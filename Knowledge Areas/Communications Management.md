# Key Concepts
- ***Communication*** is the process of exchanging information, intended or involuntary, between individuals and/or groups. Communications describes the means by which information can be sent or received, either through activities, such as meetings and presentations, or artifacts, such as emails, social media, project reports, or project documentation. Project Communications Management addresses both the process of communication, as well as management of communications activities and artifacts.
- Effective communication creates a bridge between diverse stakeholders whose differences will generally have an impact or influence upon the project execution or outcome, so it is vital that all communication is clear and concise.
- Communication activities include internal and external, formal and informal, written and oral.
- Communication can be directed upwards to senior management stakeholders, downwards to team members, or horizontally to peers. This will affect the format and content of the message.
- Communication takes place consciously or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. It includes developing strategies and plans for suitable communications artifacts, and the application of skills to enhance effectiveness.
- Effort is required to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunication, and the methods, messengers, and messages should be carefully selected.
- Effective communication depends on defining the purpose of communication, understanding the receiver of the communications, and monitoring effectiveness.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Stakeholders | Are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both? |
| Physical location | - What is the physical location of team members?<br>- Is the team colocated?<br>- Is the team in the same geographical area?<br>- Is the team distributed across multiple time zones? |
| Communications technology | - What technology is available to develop, record, transmit, retrieve, track, and store communication artifacts?<br>- What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to stakeholders? |
| Language | - Is one language used? Or are many languages used?<br>- Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse language groups? |
| Knowledge management | - Does the organization have a formal knowledge management repository?<br>- Is the repository used? |
