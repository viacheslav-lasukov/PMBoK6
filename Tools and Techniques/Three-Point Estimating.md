# Description
## For Schedule
$tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3$
- Most likely ($tM$). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned, their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and interruptions.
- Optimistic ($tO$). The activity duration based on analysis of the best- case scenario for the activity.
- Pessimistic ($tP$). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
## For Cost
Triangular distribution. $cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3$
Beta distribution. $cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6$
- Most likely ($cM$). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any predicted expenses.
- Optimistic ($cO$). The cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
- Pessimistic ($cP$). The cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
