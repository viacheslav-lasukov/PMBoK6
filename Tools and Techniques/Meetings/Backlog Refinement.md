# #agile-practice-guide 
## Purpose of the Meeting
Refine enough stories so the [[Team]] undertands what the [[User Story|stories]] are and how large the [[User Story|stories]] are in relation to each other.

## Ways to Conduct
- Encourage the [[Team|team]] to work as triads of dev, tester, [[Business Analyst|BA]]/[[Product Owner|PO]] to discuss and write the [[User Story|story]].
- Present the overall [[User Story|story]] concept to the [[Team|team]]. The [[Team|team]] discusses and refines it into as many [[User Story|stories]] as required.
- Work with the [[Team|team]] to find various ways to explore and write the [[User Story|stories]] together, making sure all of the [[User Story|stories]] are small enough so the team can produce a steady flow of completed work. Consider becoming able to complete a [[User Story|story]] at least once a day. See [[INVEST]] principles.
