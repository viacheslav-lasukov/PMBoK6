# Description
Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the [[Duration]]/cost/[[Resource]] [[Estimate]] was derived.
## May Include
### For Schedule 
- Documentation of the [[basis of estimates]] (i.e., how it was developed)
- Documentation of all [[Assumption]]s made
- Documentation of any known [[constraint]]s
- Indication of the range of possible [[Estimate]]s (e.g., ¬±10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a range of values)
- Indication of the confidence level of the final [[Estimate]]
- Documentation of [[individual project risk]]s influencing this [[Estimate]]
### For Cost
- Documentation of the basis of the [[Estimate]] (i.e., how it was developed)
- Documentation of all [[Assumption]]s made
- Documentation of any known [[constraint]]s
- Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs
- Indication of the range of possible [[Estimate]]s (e.g., US$10,000 (¬±10%) to indicate that the item is expected to cost between a range of values)
- Indication of the confidence level of the final [[Estimate]]
### For [[Resource]]s
- Method used to develop the [[Estimate]]
- [[Resource]]s used to develop the [[Estimate]] (such as [[Information]] from previous [[similar projects]])
- [[Assumption]]s associated with the [[Estimate]]
- Known [[constraint]]s
- Range of [[Estimate]]s
- Confidence level of the [[Estimate]]
- Documentation of identified risks influencing the [[Estimate]]
