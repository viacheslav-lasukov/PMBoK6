# Description
[[Schedule Compression]] technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.

Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources will shorten the activity's duration.

Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in increased risk and/or cost.
## Examples
- Approving overtime
- Bringing in additional resources
- Paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path

## Comparison with [[Fast Tracking]]
