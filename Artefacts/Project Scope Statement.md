# Description
Description of the project scope, major [[Deliverables]], assumptions, and constraints. The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including [[project scope]] and [[product scope]]. It describes the project's [[Deliverables]] in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the [[project scope]] among project stakeholders. It may contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team's work during execution, and provides the baseline for evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project's boundaries.
## Inlcudes
- **Product Scope Description** — Characteristics of the product, service, or result described in the project charter and requirements documentation.
- **Deliverables** — Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level or in great detail.
- **Acceptance Criteria** — A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted.
- **Project Exclusions** — What is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep.

## [[Project Charter]] vs. [[Project Scope Statement]]
The [[Project Charter]] contains high-level information, while the [[Project Scope Statement]] contains a detailed description of the scope components. These components are progressively elaborated throughout the project.
