Consists of formal documentation that indicates completion of the [[Project]]/[[Phase]] and the transfer of the completed [[Project]]/phase [[deliverables]] to others, such as an [[Operation]]s group or to the next [[Phase]].

During project closure, the [[Roles/Project Manager]] reviews prior phase documentation, customer acceptance documentation from the [[5.5 Validate Scope]] process, and the [[agreement]] (if applicable) to ensure that all project requirements are completed prior to finalizing the [[Closing|closure]].

If the [[Project]] was terminated prior to completion, the formal documentation indicates why it was terminated and formalizes the [[Procedure]]s for the transfer of the finished and unfinished [[deliverables]] of the cancelled [[Project]] to others.
