# In Adaptive Environments
- Adaptive life cycles develop a set of high-level plans for the initial requirements and progressively elaborate requirements to an appropriate level of detail for the planning cycle.
- Projects navigating high degrees of complexity and uncertainty should involve as many team members and stakeholders as possible in the planning processes. The intent is to overcome uncertainty by incorporating a wide band of input into planning.
