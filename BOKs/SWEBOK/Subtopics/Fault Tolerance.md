Increases [[software]] reliability by:
1. detecting errors
2. recovering from them if possible
3. containing their effects if recovery is not possible

- backing up and retrying
- using auxiliary code
- using voting algorithms
- replacing an erroneous value with a phony value that will have a benign effect
