# Description
Generates the project [[schedule model]].

It employs several other techniques:
- [[Multicriteria Decision Analysis]]
- [[Resource Optimization]]
- Modeling techniques:
	- [[What-if Scenario Analysis]]
	- [[Simulation]]

Additional analysis includes but is not limited to:
- Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the probability of a schedule slip.
- Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long lead items that would necessitate use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.
