# Description
Provides a direct way of viewing individuals in their environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed processes when the people who use the product have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements. Observation is also known as ‚Äújob shadowing.‚Äù It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business expert performing a job. It can also be done by a ‚Äúparticipant observer‚Äù who actually performs a process or procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements.
