# Description
Can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates.

May include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project costs.

Most likely to be reliable when:
- Historical information used to develop the model is accurate
- Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable
- Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project
