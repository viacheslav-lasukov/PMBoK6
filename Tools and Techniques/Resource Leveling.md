A [[resource optimization]] #tool-technique in which adjustments are made to the [[project schedule]] to optimize the allocation of [[Resource]]s and which may affect [[Critical Path]].

Start and [[Finish Date]]s are adjusted based on [[Resource]] [[Constraint]]s with the goal of balancing the demand for [[Resource]]s with the available supply.

Can be used when shared or critically required [[Resource]]s are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over-allocated, such as when a [[Resource]] has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period, or there is a need to keep [[Resource]] usage at a constant level.

Can often cause the original [[Critical Path]] to change.
