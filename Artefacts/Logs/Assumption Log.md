See [[Assumption]].

High-level strategic and operational [[Assumption]]s and [[Constraint]]s are normally identified in the [[Business Case]] before the project is initiated and will flow into the [[Project Charter]].

Lower-level activity and task [[Assumption]]s are generated throughout the project such as defining technical specifications, estimates, the schedule, risks, etc. It is used to record all [[Assumption]]s and [[Constraint]]s throughout the project life cycle.
