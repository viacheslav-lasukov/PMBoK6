# Description
Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur.

For some risks, it is appropriate for the project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan.

Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a [[seller]], should be defined and tracked.

Risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.
