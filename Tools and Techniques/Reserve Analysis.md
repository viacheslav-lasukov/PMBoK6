# Description
Is used to determine the amount of [[Contingency Reserves]] and [[Management Reserves]] needed for the project.

Compares the amount of the [[Contingency Reserves]] remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the [[project]] in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.

Duration estimates may include [[Contingency Reserves]], sometimes referred to as schedule/cost reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty.

[[Contingency Reserves]] are associated with the known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework.

The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration/budget or a fixed number of work periods.

[[Contingency Reserves]] may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated.

As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated.

Contingency should be clearly identified in the schedule/cost documentation.
