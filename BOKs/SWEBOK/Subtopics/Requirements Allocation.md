|        | The assignment to [[architecture component]]s responsible for satisfying the [[requirement]]s.<br><br>Is important to permit detailed analysis of [[requirement]]s: once a set of [[requirement]]s has been allocated to a component, the individual [[requirement]]s can be further analyzed to discover further [[requirement]]s on how the component needs to interact with other components in order to satisfy the allocated [[requirement]]s.<br><br>In large projects, allocation stimulates a new round of analysis for each subsystem.                                        | The process of assigning [[requirement]]s to be implemented by specific [[Solution]] components. |
|        | Requirements for a particular braking performance for a car (braking distance, safety in poor driving conditions, smoothness of application, pedal pressure required, and so on) may be allocated to the braking hardware (mechanical and hydraulic assemblies) and an antilock braking system (ABS). Only when a requirement for an antilock braking system has been identified, and the requirements allocated to it, can the capabilities of the ABS, the braking hardware, and emergent properties (such as car weight) be used to identify the detailed ABS software requirements |                                                                                                  |
