One of the [[Procurement Documentation]].

Are used to solicit [[Proposal]]s from prospective [[Seller]]s. Terms such as bid, tender, or quotation are generally used when the [[Seller]] selection decision is based on price (as when buying commercial or standard items), while a term such as [[Proposal]] is generally used when other considerations such as technical capability or technical approach are the most important. Specific procurement terminology used may vary by industry and location of the procurement.

Depending on the goods or services needed, the [[bidding documents]] can include:

| Document | Is used when |
| ---- | ---- |
| Request for [[Information]] (RFI) | More [[Information]] on the goods and services to be acquired is needed from the [[Seller]]s. It will typically be followed by an RFQ or RFP. |
| Request for quotation (RFQ) | aka **Invitation for Bid**. More [[Information]] is needed on how vendors would satisfy the requirements and/or how much it will cost. |
| Request for [[Proposal]] (RFP) | There is a problem and the [[Solution]] is not easy to determine. This is the most formal of the “request for” documents and has strict procurement rules for content, timeline, and [[Seller]] responses. |
The [[Buyer]] structures [[Procurement Documentation]] to facilitate an accurate and complete response from each prospective [[Seller]] and to facilitate easy evaluation of the responses. These documents include a description of the desired form of the response, the relevant procurement [[Statement of Work|SOW]], and any required contractual provisions.

The complexity and level of detail of the [[Procurement Documentation]] should be consistent with the value of, and risks associated with, the planned procurement.

[[Procurement Documentation]] are required to be sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent, appropriate responses, but flexible enough to allow consideration of any [[Seller]] suggestions for better ways to satisfy the same requirements.
