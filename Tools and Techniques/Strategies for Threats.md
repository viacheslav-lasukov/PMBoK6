# Description
For individual project risks.
## Escalate
Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the [[project sponsor]] agrees that a threat is outside the [[project scope]] or that the proposed response would exceed the [[Project Manager]]'s authority. Escalated risks are managed at the [[program]] level, [[portfolio]] level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the [[project]] level. The [[Project Manager]] determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates the details to that person or part of the [[organization]]. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the [[project team]] after escalation, although they may be recorded in the [[risk register]] for information.
## Avoid
Risk avoidance is when the [[project team]] acts to eliminate the threat or protect the [[project]] from its **impact**. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high **probability** of occurrence and a large negative **impact**. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the [[project management plan]] or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its **probability** of occurrence to zero. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the [[project objectives]] from the risk's impact if it were to occur. 
### Examples
- removing the cause of a threat
- extending the schedule
- changing the [[project strategy]]
- reducing [[project scope]]
- clarifying requirements
- obtaining information
- improving communication
- acquiring expertise
## Transfer
Involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. [[Agreement]] may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party.
### Examples
- use of insurance
- performance bonds
- warranties
- guarantees
## Mitigate
Action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or **impact** of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Mitigation may involve prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product.

Response might reduce the **impact** by targeting factors that drive the severity, e.g., designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.
### Examples
- adopting less complex processes
- conducting more tests
- choosing a more stable [[seller]]
## Accept
Acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. May be appropriate for low- priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. 
### Can Be
- **Active**. Establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs.
- **Passive**. Involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly.
