# Description
[[Schedule Compression]] technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings.

Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk.

Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path.

Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned and increases quality risk.

Fast tracking may also increase project costs.
