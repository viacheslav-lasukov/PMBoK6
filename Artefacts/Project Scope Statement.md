# Description
Description of the project scope, major [[Deliverables]], [[Assumption Log|Assumptions]], and constraints.

Documents the entire scope, including [[Project Scope]] and [[Product Scope]]. It describes the project's [[Deliverables]] in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the [[Project Scope]] among [[Stakeholders]].

May contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the [[Team]] to perform more detailed planning, guides the [[Team]]'s work during execution, and provides the baseline for evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project's boundaries.
## Inlcudes
- [[Product Scope Description]]
- [[Deliverables]]
- [[Acceptance Criteria]]
- Project Exclusions — What is excluded from the [[Project]]. Explicitly stating what is out of the [[project scope]] helps manage [[Stakeholders]]’ expectations and can reduce [[Scope Creep]].

## [[Project Charter]] vs. [[Project Scope Statement]]
The [[Project Charter]] contains high-level information, while the [[Project Scope Statement]] contains a detailed description of the scope components. These components are progressively elaborated throughout the project.
