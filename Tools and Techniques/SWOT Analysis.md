# Description
![[SWOT Analysis.png]]
Examines the project from the following perspectives:
- strengths
- weaknesses
- opportunities
- threats

For [[11.2 Identify Risks|Risks Identification]], it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks.

Starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general.

Then identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.
