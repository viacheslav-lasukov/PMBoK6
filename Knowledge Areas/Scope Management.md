# Key Concepts
- Scope can refer to product scope (the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result), or to project scope (the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions).
- Project life cycles range along a continuum from predictive to adaptive or agile. In a life cycle that uses a predictive approach, the project deliverables are defined at the beginning of the project and any changes to the scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile approach, the deliverables are developed over multiple iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved for each iteration when it begins.
- Completion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan. Completion of the product scope is measured against the product requirements.

# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Knowledge and requirements management | - Does the organization have formal or informal knowledge and requirements management systems?<br>- What guidelines should the project manager establish for requirements to be reused in the future? |
| Validation and control | - Does the organization have existing formal or informal validation and control-related policies, procedures, and guidelines? |
| Use of agile approach | - Does the organization use agile approaches in managing projects? Is the development approach iterative or incremental? Is a predictive approach used? Will a hybrid approach be productive? |
| Governance | - Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures, and guidelines? |
