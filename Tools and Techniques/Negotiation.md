# Description
A discussion aimed at reaching an agreement.
## Resource Negotiation
The [[project management team]]'s ability to influence others plays an important role in negotiating resource allocation, as does the politics of the organizations involved. For example, convincing a [[Functional Manager]] about the high visibility of the project may influence him or her to assign the best resources to this project over competing ones.
### Negotiate With
- **[[Functional Manager]]s**. Ensure that the project receives the best resources possible in the required timeframe and until their responsibilities are complete.
- **Other [[project management team]]s within the performing [[organization]]**. Appropriately assign or share scarce or specialized resources.
- **External organizations and suppliers**. Provide appropriate, scarce, specialized, qualified, certified, or other specific team or physical resources. Special consideration should be given to external negotiating policies, practices, processes, guidelines, legal, and other such criteria.
## Procurement Negotiation
Clarifies the structure, rights, and obligations of the parties and other terms of the purchases so that mutual agreement can be reached prior to signing the [[Agreement|contract]].

Final document language reflects all [[Agreement]] reached.

[[Negotiation]] concludes with a signed [[Agreement|contract]] document or other formal agreement that can be executed by both [[buyer]] and [[seller]].

Negotiation should be led by a member of the [[procurement team]] that has the [[Authority]] to sign contracts.

[[Project Manager]] and other members of the [[project management team]] may be present during [[negotiation]] to provide assistance as needed.
