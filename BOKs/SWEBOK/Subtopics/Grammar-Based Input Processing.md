Involves syntax analysis, or parsing, of the input token stream.

Involves the creation of a data structure (called a parse tree or syntax tree) representing the input data.

The inorder traversal of the parse tree usually gives the expression just parsed. The parser checks the symbol table for the presence of programmer-defined variables that populate the tree. After building the parse tree, the program uses it as input to the computational processes.
