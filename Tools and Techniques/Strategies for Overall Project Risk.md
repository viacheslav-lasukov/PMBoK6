# Description
For overall project risks.

| Strategy | Description | Examples |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Avoid | Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the [[project]], an avoid strategy may be adopted. Involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the [[project]] as a whole and bring the [[project]] back within the thresholds. Where it is not possible to bring the [[project]] back within the thresholds, the [[project]] may be canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable. | - removal of high-risk elements of the [[project scope]] |
| Exploit | Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. Involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the [[project]] as a whole. Risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity. | - addition of high-benefit elements of the [[project scope]] to add value or benefits to [[stakeholders]] |
| Transfer/share | If the level of overall project risk is high but the [[organization]] is unable to address it effectively, a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the [[organization]]. Where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive overall project risk, ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits.  | - setting up a collaborative business structure in which the [[buyer]] and the [[seller]] share the overall project risk<br>- launching a joint venture or special-purpose company<br>- subcontracting key elements of the project |
| Mitigate/enhance | Involves changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving the [[project objectives]]. Is used where overall project risk is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive. | - replanning the project<br>- changing the [[project scope]] and boundaries<br>- modifying project priority<br>- changing resource allocations<br>- adjusting delivery times |
| Accept | Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the [[organization]] may choose to continue with the [[project]] as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. | - **Active**. establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds.<br>- **Passive**. involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change significantly. |
