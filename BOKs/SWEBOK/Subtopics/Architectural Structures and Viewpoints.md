Different high-level facets of a software design can be described and documented. These facets are often called views. A view represents a partial aspect of a [[Software Architecture]] that shows specific properties of a software system.

Views pertain to distinct issues associated with [[Software Design]]:
- logical view (satisfying the functional requirements)
- process view (concurrency issues)
- physical view (distribution issues)
- development view (how the design is broken down into implementation units with explicit representation of the dependencies among the units).
