Description: "Documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for the authorization of further project management activities. The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the project success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project business document that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used before the project initiation and may result in a go/no-go decision for the project."

# Business needs
- Determination of what is prompting the need for action;
- Situational statement documenting the business problem or opportunity to be addressed including the value to be delivered to the organization;
- Identification of stakeholders affected;
- Identification of the scope.
# Analysis of the situation
- Identification of organizational strategies, goals, and objectives;
- Identification of root cause(s) of the problem or main contributors of an opportunity;
- Gap analysis of capabilities needed for the project versus existing capabilities of the organization;
- Identification of known risks; Identification of critical success factors;
- Identification of decision criteria by which the various courses of action may be assessed;
     Examples of criteria categories used for analysis of a situation are:
	- ***Required***. This is a criterion that is “required” to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
	- ***Desired***. This is a criterion that is “desired” to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
	- ***Optional***. This is a criterion that is not essential. Fulfillment of this criterion may become a differentiator between alternative courses of action.
- Identification of a set of options to be considered for addressing the business problem or opportunity. Options are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Options may also be described as business scenarios. For example, a business case could present the following three options:
	- ***Do nothing***. This is also referred to as the “business as usual” option. Selection of this option results in the project not being authorized.
	- ***Do the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity***. The minimum may be established by identifying the set of documented criteria that are key in addressing the problem or opportunity.
	- ***Do more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity***. This option meets the minimum set of criteria and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of these options documented in the business case.
# Recommendation
- A statement of the recommended option to pursue in the project;
- Items to include in the statement may include but are not limited to:
	- Analysis results for the potential option;
	- Constraints, assumptions, risks, and dependencies for the potential options; and
	- Success measures (see Section 1.2.6.4).  
- An implementation approach that may include but is not limited to:
	- Milestones,
	- Dependencies,
	- Roles and responsibilities.
# Evaluation
- Statement describing the plan for measuring benefits the project will deliver. This should include any ongoing operational aspects of the recommended option beyond initial implementation.
