# Description
Lists of [[Seller]]s that have been properly vetted can streamline the steps needed to advertise the opportunity and shorten the timeline for the [[Seller]] selection process.

For projects with few procurements and relatively simple procurements, some of these outputs may be combined.

However, for projects with large, complex procurements and where much of the work is done by [[Seller|contractor]]s, there are several different types of documentation. Table 12-1 is a representative list of common types of documents used in procurements and some of their contents. Given the legal nature of procurements, this list should not be considered prescriptive, but rather it should be used as a general outline of types of documents and contents needed to conduct procurement. The organization, environment, and legal [[Constraint]]s dictate the required procurement documents and [[Information]] needed for the project.
