# Description
Is an output of a [[schedule model]] that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources.

At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish date for each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the [[project schedule]] remains preliminary until resource assignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs no later than the completion of the [[project management plan]].

A target [[Schedule Model]] may also be developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity.

May be presented in summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail.
## Formats
* **Bar charts** ([[Gant Chart]]). Represent schedule information where activities are listed on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal bars placed according to start and finish dates. Float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the broader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports.
* **Milestone charts**. similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of major deliverables and key external interfaces.
* **[[Schedule Network Diagram]]**. Usually shows both the project network logic and the project's critical path schedule activities. This example also shows how each [[Work Package]] is planned as a series of related activities. Presentations:
	* "activity-on-node" diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, aka "pure logic diagram"
	* "time-scaled schedule network" diagram format aka "logic bar chart"
	* "time-scaled logic" diagram showing a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. Optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the same line of the diagram in sequence
