# Description
Hierarchical [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]] of the total scope of work to be carried out by the [[Team]] to accomplish the [[Objective]]s and create the required [[Deliverables]].

Each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of the work.
## Example

## Structuring Ways
- Using **phases** of the [[Project Life Cycle]] as the 2nd level of [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]], with the [[deliverables]] inserted at the 3rd level
  ![[WBS Organized by Phase.png]]
- Using **major [[deliverables]]** as the second level of [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]]

- Incorporating **subcomponents** that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as contracted work. The [[Seller]] then develops the supporting [[Agreement|contract]] WBS as part of the contracted work
