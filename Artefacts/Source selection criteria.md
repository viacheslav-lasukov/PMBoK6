# Description
One of the [[Procurement Documentation]].

In choosing evaluation criteria, the [[buyer]] seeks to ensure that the [[proposal]] selected will offer the best quality for the services required.
## Includes
- Capability and capacity
- Product cost and life cycle cost
- Delivery dates
- Technical expertise and approach
- Specific relevant experience
- Adequacy of the proposed approach and work plan in responding to the [[Statement of Work|SOW]]
- Key staff's qualifications, availability, and competence
- Financial stability of the firm
- Management experience 
- Suitability of the knowledge transfer program, including training

For international projects, evaluation criteria may include ‚Äúlocal content‚Äù requirements, for example, participation by nationals among proposed key staff.

The specific criteria may be a numerical score, color-code, or a written description of how well the [[seller]] satisfies the buying organization's needs.

The criteria will be part of a weighting system that can be used to select a single [[seller]] that will be asked to sign a [[Agreement|contract]] and establish a negotiating sequence by ranking all the proposals by the weighted evaluation scores assigned to each [[proposal]].
