Establishes the basis for agreement between [[customer]]s and [[Seller|Contractor]]s or [[supplier]]s on what the [[software product]] is to do as well as what it is not expected to do.

Permits a rigorous assessment of [[requirement]]s before design can begin and reduces later redesign.

Should provide a realistic basis for estimating product [[cost]], [[risk]]s, and [[schedule]]s.

Is written in natural language, but may be supplemented by formal or semiformal descriptions.
