# Description
The component of the [[project management plan]].

Describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed.
## Includes
* **Risk strategy**. Describes the general approach to managing risk
* **Methodology**. Defines the specific approaches, tools, and [[Data]] sources that will be used to perform [[11 Risk Management]]
* **[[Roles and Responsibilities]]**. Defines the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of activity described in the [[risk management plan]], and clarifies their responsibilities.
* **Funding**. Identifies the funds needed to perform activities related to [[11 Risk Management]]. Establishes protocols for the application of [[Contingency Reserves]] and [[Management Reserves]].
* **Timing**. Defines when and how often the [[11 Risk Management|Risk Management]] processes will be performed throughout the [[Life Cycle]], and establishes [[11 Risk Management|Risk Management]] activities for inclusion into the [[project schedule]].
* **Risk categories**. Provide a means for grouping [[Individual Project Risk]]s. A common way to structure risk categories is with a [[Risk Breakdown Structure|RBS]]. Where an [[Risk Breakdown Structure|RBS]] is not used, an [[Organization]] may use a custom [[Risk Categorization]] framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on [[Objective]]s.
* **Stakeholder [[risk appetite]]**. The [[risk appetite]]s of key [[Stakeholders]], as they inform the details of the [[11.1 Plan Risk Management]] process. In particular, stakeholder [[risk appetite]] should be expressed as measurable [[risk threshold]]s around each project [[Objective]]. These [[threshold]]s will determine the acceptable level of [[Overall Project Risk]] [[Risk Exposure|Exposure]], and they are also used to inform the definitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing [[Individual Project Risk]]s.
* **Definitions of risk probability and impacts**. Definitions of [[Risk]] probability and impact levels are specific to the project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The [[Project]] may generate specific definitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general definitions provided by the organization. The number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the [[11 Risk Management]] process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels), and fewer for a simple process (usually three).
  ![[Example of Definitions for Probability and Impacts.png]]
  Example of definitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact definitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities (reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).
* [[Probability and Impact Matrix]].  Prioritization rules may be specified by the organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to the specific project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using positive definitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact definitions for threats. Descriptive terms (such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and impact matrix is presented in Figure 11-5, which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme.
* **Reporting formats**. Reporting formats define how the outcomes of the [[11 Risk Management]] process will be documented, analyzed, and communicated. This section of the risk management plan describes the content and format of the [[risk register]] and the risk report, as well as any other required outputs from the [[11 Risk Management]] processes.
* **Tracking**. Tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded and how [[11 Risk Management]] processes will be [[Audit]]ed.
