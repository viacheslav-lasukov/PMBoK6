Used to show data flow among elements.

Provides a description based on modeling the flow of information around a network of operational elements, with each element making use of or modifying the information flowing into that element.

Data flows (and therefore data flow diagrams) can be used for security analysis, as they offer identification of possible paths for attack and disclosure of confidential information
