# Description
One of the [[Procurement Documentation]].

For large procurements, the procuring organization may elect to either prepare its own independent estimate or have a [[Cost Estimates]] prepared by an outside professional estimator to serve as a benchmark on proposed responses.

Significant differences in [[cost estimates]] can be an indication that:
- procurement [[Statement of Work|SOW]] was deficient or ambiguous
- prospective [[seller]]s either misunderstood or failed to respond fully to the procurement [[Statement of Work|SOW]]
