A [[resource optimization]] #tool-technique in which [[Free Float]] and [[Total Float]] are used without affecting the [[Critical Path]].

Adjusts the activities of a [[Schedule Model]] such that the requirements for [[Resource]]s on the project do not exceed certain predefined [[Resource]] limits.

As opposed to [[Resource]] leveling, the project's [[Critical Path]] is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed.

Activities may only be delayed within their [[Free Float]] and [[Total Float]].
