# Description
Relates to [[Motivation]].

The original plan for rewarding people is developed during the [[9.1 Plan Resource Management]] process.

Rewards will be effective only if they satisfy a need that is valued by that individual.

Reward decisions are made, formally or informally, during the process of managing the project team.

Cultural differences should be considered when determining recognition and rewards.

People are motivated when they feel they are valued in the organization and this value is demonstrated by the rewards given to them.

Generally, money is viewed as a tangible aspect of any reward system, but intangible rewards could be equally or even more effective.

Most [[project team]] members are motivated by an opportunity to grow, accomplish, be appreciated, and apply their professional skills to meet new challenges.

A good strategy for [[Project Manager]]s is to give the team recognition throughout the life cycle of the project rather than waiting until the project is completed.
