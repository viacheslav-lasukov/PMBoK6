Dividing and subdividing the [[Project Scope]] and [[deliverables]] into smaller, more manageable parts.

The level of [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]] is often guided by the degree of [[Control]] needed to effectively manage the project.

The level of detail for [[Work Package]]s will vary with the size and complexity of the [[Project]].

Different [[Deliverables]] can have different levels of [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]].

As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and [[Control]] the work is enhanced.
## Excessive [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]] can lead to:
- inefficient use of [[Resource]]s
- decreased efficiency in performing the work
- difficulty aggregating [[Data]] over different levels of the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]
## Involves Activities
- Identifying and analyzing the [[Deliverables]] and related work
- Structuring and organizing the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]
- Decomposing the upper [[Work Breakdown Structure]] levels into lower-level detailed components
- Developing and assigning identification codes to the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] components
- Verifying that the degree of [[Tools and Techniques/Decomposition]] of the [[deliverables]] is appropriate
