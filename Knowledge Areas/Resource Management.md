# Key Concepts
- Project resources include both physical resources (equipment, materials, facilities, and infrastructure) and team resources (individuals with assigned project roles and responsibilities).
- Different skills and competences are needed to manage team resources versus physical resources.
- The project manager should be both the leader and the manager of the project team, and should invest suitable effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and empowering team members.
- The project manager should be aware of team influences such as the team environment, geographical location of team members, communication among stakeholders, organizational change management, internal and external politics, cultural issues, and organizational uniqueness.
- The project manager is responsible for proactively developing team skills and competences while retaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation.
- Physical resource management is concentrated on allocating and utilizing the physical resources needed for successful completion of the project in an efficient and effective way. Failure to manage and control resources efficiently may reduce the chance of completing the project successfully.
