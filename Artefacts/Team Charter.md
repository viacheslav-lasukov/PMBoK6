# Description
A document that establishes the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines for the team.

Establishes clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team members.

Discussing areas such as codes of conduct, communication, decision making, and meeting etiquette allows team members to discover values that are important to one another.

The team charter works best when the team develops it, or at least has an opportunity to contribute to it.

All project team members share responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter are followed.

The team charter can be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure a continued understanding of the team ground rules and to orient and integrate new team members.
