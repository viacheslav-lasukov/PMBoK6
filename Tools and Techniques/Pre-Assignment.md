# Description
When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This situation can occur if the project is the result of specific resources being identified as part of a competitive [[proposal]] or if the project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons. [[Pre-assignment]] might also include the team members who have already been assigned in [[4.1 Develop Project Charter]] Process or other processes before the initial [[Resource Management Plan]] has been completed.
