Shows the [[Resource]]s assigned to each [[Work Package]].

Is used to illustrate the connections between [[Work Package]]s, or [[Activity|Activities]], and [[Team]] members.

The matrix format shows all [[Activity|Activities]] associated with one person and all people associated with one [[activity]]. This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has [[Authority]] for the work.
## Can be developed at various levels
- high-level [[Resource Assignment Matrix|RAM]] can define the responsibilities of a [[Team]], group, or unit within each component of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]
- lower-level [[Resource Assignment Matrix|RAM]]s are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of [[Authority]] for specific [[Activity|Activities]].
## Examples
- [[RACI]]
