Description: "[[Risk Workshop#Description|üìù]]"

# Description
Includes some form of [[brainstorming]], but other risk identification techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process defined in the [[risk management plan]].

Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting.

It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop.

On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the [[project sponsor]], [[Subject Matter Expert]]s, [[seller]]s, representatives of the [[Customer]], or other project stakeholders.

Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team.

A risk owner, who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk

The goals of this meeting ‚Äî review:
- previously identified risks
- assessment of probability and impacts (and possibly other risk parameters)
- categorization
- prioritization
