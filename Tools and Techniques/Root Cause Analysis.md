# Description
An analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying reason that causes a [[Variance]], defect, or risk.

A root cause may underlie more than one [[Variance]], defect, or risk.

It may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them.

When all root causes for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.
