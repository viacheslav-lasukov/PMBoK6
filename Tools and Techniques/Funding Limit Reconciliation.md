# Description
The expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project. A [[Variance]] between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of work to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing [[Imposed Date]] [[Constraint]]s for work into the project schedule.
