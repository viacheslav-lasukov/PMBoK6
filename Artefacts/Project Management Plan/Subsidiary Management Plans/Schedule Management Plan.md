# Description
Establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. How will you do scheduling?

## May Be
- formal or informal
- highly detailed or broadly framed
## Establishes
- **Project [[schedule model]] development**. The [[Scheduling Methodology|scheduling methodology]] and the [[Scheduling Tool|scheduling tool]] to be used in the development of the project [[schedule model]] are specified.
- **Release and [[iteration]] length**. When using an adaptive, the time-boxed periods for releases, waves, and iterations are specified. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward completion of a goal. Time-boxing helps to minimize [[scope creep]] as it forces the teams to process essential features first, then other features when time permits.
- **Level of accuracy**. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity duration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.
- **Units of measure**. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, or meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.
- **Organizational procedures links**. The [[Work Breakdown Structure]] provides the framework for the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.
- **Project [[schedule model]] maintenance**. The process used to update the status and record progress of the project in the [[schedule model]] during the execution of the project is defined.
- **Control thresholds**. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate an agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.
- **Rules of performance measurement**. [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] rules or other physical measurement rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify:
	- Rules for establishing percent complete,
	- [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] techniques (e.g., baselines, fixed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed
	- Schedule performance measurements such as [[Schedule Variance|SV]] and [[Schedule Performance Index|SPI]] used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.
- **Reporting formats**. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.
