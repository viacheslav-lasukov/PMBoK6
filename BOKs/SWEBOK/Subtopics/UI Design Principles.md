- **Learnability**. The software should be easy to learn so that the user can rapidly start working with the software
- **User familiarity**. The interface should use terms and concepts drawn from the experiences of the people who will use the software
- **Consistency**. The interface should be consistent so that comparable operations are activated in the same way
- **Minimal surprise**. The behavior of software should not surprise users
- **Recoverability**. The interface should provide mechanisms allowing users to recover from errors
- **User guidance**. The interface should give meaningful feedback when errors occur and provide context-related help to users
- **User diversity**. The interface should provide appropriate interaction mechanisms for diverse types of users and for users with different capabilities (blind, poor eyesight, deaf, colorblind, etc.).
