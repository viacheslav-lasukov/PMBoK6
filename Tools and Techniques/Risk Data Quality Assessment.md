# Description
Evaluates the degree to which the data about individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for [[11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis|Qualitative Risk Analysis]].

The use of low-quality risk data may lead to a [[11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis|Qualitative Risk Analysis]] that is of little use to the project.

If data quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data.

Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring the project's stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics:
- completeness
- objectivity
- relevancy
- timeliness

A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality score.
