# Description
Monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to the [[Scope Baseline]]. Ensures all requested changes and recommended corrective or preventive actions are processed through the [[4.6 Perform Integrated Change Control]] process. It is also used to manage the actual changes when they occur and is integrated with the other control processes. The uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is referred to as [[scope creep]]. Change is inevitable; therefore, some type of change control process is mandatory for every project.
## Key Benefits
[[Scope Baseline]] is maintained throughout the project.
