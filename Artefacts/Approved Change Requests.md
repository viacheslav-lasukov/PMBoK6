# Description
As part of the [[4.6 Perform Integrated Change Control]] process, a [[change log]] update indicates that some changes are approved and some are not.

[[Change requests]] are processed according to the [[change management plan]] by the [[project manager]], [[Change Control Board|CCB]], or an assigned [[team member]].

As a result, changes may be approved, deferred, or rejected.

[[Approved change requests]] will be implemented through the [[4.3 Direct and Manage Project Work]] process.

Deferred or rejected [[change requests]] are communicated to the person or group requesting the change.

The disposition of all [[change requests]] are recorded in the [[change log]] as a Project Documents update.
