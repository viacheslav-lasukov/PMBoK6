Is used to determine whether work or [[Deliverables]] can best be accomplished by the [[project team]] or should be purchased from outside sources.

Includes evaluating the risks involved with each make-or-buy decision.

Factors to consider in the make-or-buy decision:
- organization's current resource allocation
- resources' skills and abilities
- need for specialized expertise
- desire to not expand permanent employment obligations
- need for independent expertise

In order to decide whether to include something as part of the project or purchase it externally, may use techniques:
- payback period
- return on investment (ROI)
- internal rate of return (IRR)
- discounted cash flow
- net present value (NPV)
