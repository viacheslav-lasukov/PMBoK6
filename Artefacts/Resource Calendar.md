Description: "[[Resource Calendar#Description|üìù]]"
---
Identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific [[Resource]] is available.

Information on which [[Resource]]s (team, equipment, material) are potentially available during a planned activity period is used for estimating [[Resource]] utilization.

[[Resource]] calendars also specify when, and for how long, identified team and physical [[Resource]]s will be available during the project. This [[Information]] may be at the activity or project level. This includes consideration of attributes such as [[Resource]] experience and/or skill level, as well as various [[Geographic Distribution of Facilities and Resources|geographical locations]].
