# Description
Obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected [[Product]] before actually building it.

Allows [[Stakeholders]] to experiment with a model of the final [[Product]] rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements.

Supports the concept of [[Pogressive Elaboration]] in [[Iterative Life Cycle|iterative]] cycles of mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision. When enough feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently complete to move to a design or build phase.
## Examples
- small-scale [[Product]]s
- computer generated 2D and 3D models
- [[Mock-Up]]s
- simulations
