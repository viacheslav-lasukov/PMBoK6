# Description
It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands before deciding on the selection method.

Since competitive selection methods may require [[Seller]]s to invest a large amount of time and [[Resource]]s upfront, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in the [[Procurement Documentation]] so bidders know how they will be evaluated.
## Selection Methods
| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Least cost** | Is ppropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where well-established practices and standards exist and from which a specific and well-defined outcome is expected, which can be executed at different costs. |
| **Qualifications only** | Applies when the time and cost of a full selection process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The [[Buyer]] establishes a short list and selects the bidder with the best credibility, qualifications, experience, expertise, areas of specialization, and references. |
| **[[Quality]]-based/highest technical [[Proposal]] score** | The selected firm is asked to submit a [[Proposal]] with both technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the [[Agreement]] if the technical [[Proposal]] proves acceptable. Using this method, technical proposals are first evaluated based on the [[Quality]] of the technical solution offered. The [[Seller]] who submitted the highest-ranked technical [[Proposal]] is selected if their financial [[Proposal]] can be negotiated and accepted. |
| **[[Quality]] and cost-based** | The [[Quality]] and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a factor in the [[Seller]] selection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are greater for the project, [[Quality]] should be a key element when compared to cost. |
| **Sole source** | The [[Buyer]] asks a specific [[Seller]] to prepare technical and financial proposals, which are then negotiated. Since there is no competition, this method is acceptable only when properly justified and should be viewed as an exception. |
| **Fixed budget** | The fixed-budget method requires disclosing the available [[Budget]] to invited [[Seller]]s in the RFP and selecting the highest-ranking technical [[Proposal]] within the budget. Because [[Seller]]s are subject to a cost constraint, they will adapt the scope and [[Quality]] of their offer to that budget. The [[Buyer]] should therefore ensure that the [[Budget]] is compatible with the SOW and that the [[Seller]] will be able to perform the tasks within the budget. This method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely defined, no changes are anticipated, and the [[Budget]] is fixed and cannot be exceeded. |
