# Description
Is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the [[Schedule Model]].

Calculates the early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the [[Schedule Network Diagram]].

The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float‚Äîusually zero.
