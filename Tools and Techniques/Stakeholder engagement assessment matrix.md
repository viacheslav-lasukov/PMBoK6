# Description
Supports comparison between the current engagement levels of [[stakeholders]] and the desired [[Stakeholder Engagement|engagement]] levels required for successful project delivery.
## Engagement Levels
- **Unaware**. Unaware of the [[project]] and potential impacts.
- **Resistant**. Aware of the [[project]] and potential impacts but resistant to any changes that may occur as a result of the work or outcomes of the [[project]]. These [[stakeholders]] will be unsupportive of the work or outcomes of the [[project]].
- **Neutral**. Aware of the [[project]], but neither supportive nor unsupportive.
- **Supportive**. Aware of the [[project]] and potential impacts and supportive of the work and its outcomes.
## Example
![[Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix.png]]
- **C** represents the current engagement level of each stakeholder
- **D** indicates the level that the [[project team]] has assessed as essential to ensure project success (desired)
The gap between **C**urrent and **D**esired for each [[stakeholders]] will direct the level of communications necessary to effectively engage the [[Stakeholders]]. The closing of this gap between current and desired is an essential element of [[13.4 Monitor Stakeholder Engagement|monitoring stakeholder engagement]].
