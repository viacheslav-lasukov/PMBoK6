A discussion aimed at reaching an agreement.
## [[Resource]] Negotiation
The [[Project Management Team]]'s ability to influence others plays an important role in negotiating [[Resource]] allocation, as does the politics of the organizations involved. For example, convincing a [[Functional Manager]] about the high visibility of the project may influence him or her to assign the best [[Resource]]s to this project over competing ones.
### Negotiate With
- **[[Functional Manager]]s**. Ensure that the project receives the best [[Resource]]s possible in the required timeframe and until their responsibilities are complete.
- **Other [[Project Management Team]]s within the [[Performing Organization]]**. Appropriately assign or share scarce or specialized [[Resource]]s.
- **External organizations and suppliers**. Provide appropriate, scarce, specialized, qualified, certified, or other specific team or physical [[Resource]]s. Special consideration should be given to external negotiating policies, practices, processes, guidelines, legal, and other such criteria.
## Procurement Negotiation
Clarifies the structure, rights, and obligations of the parties and other terms of the purchases so that mutual agreement can be reached prior to signing the [[Agreement|contract]].

Final document language reflects all [[Agreement]] reached.

[[Negotiation]] concludes with a signed [[Agreement|contract]] document or other formal agreement that can be executed by both [[Buyer]] and [[Seller]].

Negotiation should be led by a member of the procurement team that has the [[Authority]] to sign contracts.

[[Roles/Project Manager]] and other members of the [[Project Management Team]] may be present during [[negotiation]] to provide assistance as needed.
