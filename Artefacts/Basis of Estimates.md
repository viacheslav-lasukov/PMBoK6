# Description
Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration/cost/resource estimate was derived.
## May Include
### For Schedule 
- Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed)
- Documentation of all assumptions made
- Documentation of any known constraints
- Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., ¬±10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a range of values)
- Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate
- Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate
### For Cost
- Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed)
- Documentation of all assumptions made
- Documentation of any known constraints
- Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs
- Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (¬±10%) to indicate that the item is expected to cost between a range of values)
- Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate
### For Resources
- Method used to develop the estimate
- Resources used to develop the estimate (such as information from previous [[similar projects]])
- Assumptions associated with the estimate
- Known constraints
- Range of estimates
- Confidence level of the estimate
- Documentation of identified risks influencing the estimate
