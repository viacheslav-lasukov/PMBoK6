# Description
Risk categories are defined in the [[risk management plan]].

Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.
## Risk can be categorized by
- sources of risk (e.g., using [[Risk Breakdown Structure|RBS]])
- area of the project affected (e.g., using [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]])
- common root causes (see [[Root Cause Analysis]])
- other categories:
	- project phase
	- project budget
	- roles and responsibilites
