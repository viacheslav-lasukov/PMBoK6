Presents [[Information]] on sources of [[Overall Project Risk]], together with summary [[Information]] on identified [[Individual Project Risk]]s.
## Result of [[11.2 Identify Risks]]
- **Sources of [[Overall Project Risk]]**, indicating which are the most important drivers of [[Overall Project Risk]] exposure
- **Summary [[Information]] on identified [[Individual Project Risk]]s**, such as number of identified [[Threat]]s and opportunities, distribution of risks across risk categories, metrics and trends, etc.
## Result of [[11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis]]
- most important project risks (with the highest probability and impact)
- prioritized list of all identified risks on the project and a summary conclusion
## Result of [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis]]
- Assessment of [[Overall Project Risk]] exposure. [[Overall Project Risk]] is reflected in two key measures:
	1. Chances of project success, indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives (e.g., required end date or interim milestones, required cost target, etc.) given the identified [[Individual Project Risk]]s and other sources of uncertainty
	2. Degree of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted, indicated by the range of possible [[Project Outcome]]s
- Detailed probabilistic analysis of the project. Key outputs from the [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis]] are presented, such as S-curves, [[Tornado Diagram]]s, and criticality analysis, together with a narrative interpretation of the results. Possible detailed results of a [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis]] may include:
	- Amount of [[Contingency Reserves]] needed to provide a specified level of confidence
	- Identification of [[Individual Project Risk]]s or other sources of uncertainty that have the greatest effect on the project [[Critical Path]]
	- Major drivers of [[Overall Project Risk]], with the greatest influence on uncertainty in [[Project Outcome]]s
- Prioritized list of [[Individual Project Risk]]s. This list includes those [[Individual Project Risk]]s that pose the greatest [[Threat]] or present the greatest [[Opportunity]], as indicated by [[sensitivity analysis]].
- Trends in [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis|Quantitative Risk Analysis]] results. As the analysis is repeated at different times during the [[Project Life Cycle]], trends may become apparent that inform the planning of [[risk responses]].
- Recommended [[risk responses]]. The[[Risk Report]] may present suggested [[Risk Responses]] to the level of [[Overall Project Risk]] exposure or key [[Individual Project Risk]]s, based on the results of the [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis|Quantitative Risk Analysis]]. These recommendations will form inputs to the [[11.5 Plan Risk Responses]] process.
