# Description
Conducting activities that enhance the [[project team|team]]'s social relations and build a collaborative and cooperative working environment.

Activities can vary from a 5-minute agenda item in a [[Status Meeting]] to an offsite, professionally facilitated event designed to improve interpersonal relationships.

The objective of team-building activities is to help individual [[team member]]s work together effectively.

Strategies are particularly valuable when [[team member]]s operate from remote locations without the benefit of face-to-face contact.

Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing good working relationships.

While [[team building]] is essential during the initial stages of a [[project]], it should be a continuous process.

Changes in a [[Project Environment]] are inevitable, and to manage them effectively, a continuous or renewed team-building effort may be applied.

The [[Project Manager]] should continually monitor team functionality and performance to determine if any actions are needed to prevent or correct various team problems.
