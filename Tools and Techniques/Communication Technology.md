## Factors Influencing Choice
- **Urgency of the need for information**. The urgency, frequency, and format of the information to be communicated may vary from project to project and also within different phases of a project.
- **Availability and reliability of technology**. The technology that is required for distribution of project communications artifacts should be compatible, available, and accessible for all stakeholders throughout the project.
- **Ease of use**. The choice of communication technologies should be suitable for project participants and proper training events should be planned, where appropriate.
- **[[Project environment]]**. Whether the team will meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment; whether they will be located in one or multiple time zones; whether they will use multiple languages for communication; and finally, whether there are any other [[project environment]]al factors, such as various aspects of culture, which may constrain the efficiency of the communication.
- **Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information**:
	- Whether information to be communicated is sensitive or confidential. If so, additional security measures may be required.
	- Social media policies for employees to ensure appropriate behavior, security, and the protection of proprietary information.
