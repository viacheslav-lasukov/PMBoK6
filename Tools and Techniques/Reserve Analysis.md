# Description
Is used to determine the amount of [[Contingency Reserves]] and [[Management Reserves]] needed for the project.

Compares the amount of the [[Contingency Reserves]] remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in order to determine if the remaining [[Reserve]] is adequate.

Duration estimates may include [[Contingency Reserves]], sometimes referred to as schedule/cost reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty.

[[Contingency Reserves]] are associated with the known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of [[Rework]].

The [[contingency reserves]] may be a percentage of the estimated [[Activity Duration]]/budget or a fixed number of work periods.

[[Contingency Reserves]] may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated.

As more precise [[Information]] about the project becomes available, the [[contingency reserves]] may be used, reduced, or eliminated.

Contingency should be clearly identified in the schedule/cost documentation.
