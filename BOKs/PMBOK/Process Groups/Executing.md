# In Adaptive Environments
- Work in [[Agile Life Cycle|agile]], [[Iterative Life Cycle|iterative]], and adaptive project life cycles is directed and managed through [[Iteration]]s. Each [[Iteration]] is a short, fixed time period to undertake work followed by a demonstration of functionality or design. These sessions also help manage [[Stakeholder Engagement]] by showing [[increment]]s of work done and discussing future work.
- Based on the demonstration, relevant [[Stakeholders]] and the [[Team]] conduct a [[retrospective]] review. The demonstration and review helps check progress against the plan and determines if any changes to the [[Project Scope]], [[project schedule]], or execution processes are necessary. The [[retrospective]] allows issues with the execution approach to be identified and discussed in a timely fashion along with ideas for improvements. [[Retrospective]]s are a primary tool to [[4.4 Manage Project Knowledge]] and develop the team through discussions of what is working well and team-based [[problem solving]].
- While work is undertaken via short [[Iteration]]s, it is also tracked and managed against longer-term project delivery timeframes. Trends of development speed, spend, [[Defect]] rates, and team [[capacity]] that are tracked at an [[Iteration]] level are summed and extrapolated at a project level to track completion performance. Highly adaptive/[[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] approaches aim to utilize specialized team [[Knowledge]] for task completion. Rather than a [[Roles/Project Manager]] selecting and sequencing work, higher-level objectives are explained and the [[Team]] members are empowered to self-organize specific tasks as a group to best meet those objectives. This leads to the creation of practical plans with high levels of buy-in from the team members.
- Junior teams working on highly adaptive/[[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] projects typically need [[Coaching]] and work assignments before reaching this empowered team state.
