# Description
For [[individual project risk]]s.
## Escalate
Appropriate when the [[Team]] or the [[Sponsor]] agrees that an opportunity is outside the [[Project Scope]] or that the proposed response would exceed the [[Project Manager]]'s [[Authority]]. Escalated opportunities are managed at the [[Program]] level, [[Portfolio]] level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the [[Project]] level. The [[Project Manager]] determines who should be notified abosut the [[opportunity]] and communicates the details to that person or part of the [[Organization]]. It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the [[Organization]]. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the [[Team]] after escalation, although they may be recorded in the [[Risk Register]] for information.
## Exploit
May be selected for high-priority [[opportunity|opportunities]] where the [[Organization]] wants to ensure that the [[opportunity]] is realized. Seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular [[opportunity]] by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the **probability** of occurrence to 100%.
### Examples
- assigning an organization's most talented [[Resource]]s to reduce the time to completion
- using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and [[duration]]
## Share
Involves transferring ownership of an [[opportunity]] to a third party so that it shares some of the benefit if the [[opportunity]] occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared [[opportunity]] carefully so they are best able to capture the [[opportunity]] for the benefit. Often involves payment of a [[Risk]] premium to the party taking on the [[opportunity]].
### Examples
- forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures
## Enhance
Is used to increase the **probability** and/or **impact** of an opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The **probability** of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase **probability**, an enhancement response might increase the **impact** by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit.
### Examples
- adding more [[Resource]]s to an activity to finish early
## Accept
Acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken.  ay be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. 
### Can Be
- **Active**. Establish a [[Contingency Reserves]], including amounts of time, money, or [[Resource]]s to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs.
- **Passive**. Involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly.
