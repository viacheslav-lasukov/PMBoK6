# Key Concepts
- Project Integration Management is the specific responsibility of the project manager and it cannot be delegated or transferred. The project manager is the one that combines the results from all the other #pmbok6/knowledge-area s to provide an overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible for the project as a whole.
- Projects and [[Project Management]] are integrative by nature, with most tasks involving more than one #pmbok6/knowledge-area .
- The relationships of processes within the [[Project Management]] #pmbok6/process-group s and between the [[Project Management]] [[process]]es
- Project Integration Management is about:
	- Ensuring that the due dates of project deliverables, the project life cycle, and the benefits realization plan are aligned;
	- Providing a [[Project Management Plan]] to achieve the project objectives;
	- Ensuring the creation and the use of appropriate [[Knowledge]] to and from the project;
	- Managing project performance and changes to the project activities;
	- Making integrated decisions regarding key changes impacting the project;
	- Measuring and monitoring progress and taking appropriate action;
	- Collecting, analyzing and communicating project [[Information]] to relevant stakeholders;
	- Completing all the work of the project and formally closing each phase, [[Agreement|contract]], and the project as a whole; and
	- Managing phase transitions when necessary.
# Trends and Emerging Practices
- **Use of automated tools**. The volume of [[Data]] and [[Information]] that [[Project Manager]]s need to integrate makes it necessary to use a [[Project Management Information Systems|PMIS]] and automated tools to collect, analyze, and use [[Information]] to meet project objectives and realize project benefits.
- **Use of visual management tools**. Some project teams use visual management tools, rather than written plans and other documents, to capture and oversee critical project elements. Making key project elements visible to the entire team provides a real-time overview of the project status, facilitates [[Knowledge Transfer]] , and empowers team members and other stakeholders to help identify and solve issues.
- **Project [[Knowledge Management]] **. The increasingly mobile and transitory work force requires a more rigorous process of identifying [[Knowledge]] throughout the project life cycle and transferring it to the target audience so that the [[Knowledge]] is not lost.
- **Expanding the project manager's responsibilities**. [[Project Manager]]s are being called on to initiate and finalize the project, such as [[Business Case]] development and [[Benefits Management Plan]]. Historically, these activities have been the responsibility of management and the [[Project Management Office|PMO]], but project managers are more frequently collaborating with them to better meet project objectives and deliver benefits. Project managers are also engaging in more comprehensive identification and engagement of stakeholders. This includes managing the interfaces with various functional and operational departments and senior management personnel.
- **[[Hybrid Life Cycle|Hybrid]] methodologies**. Some project management methodologies are evolving to incorporate successfully applied new practices. Examples:
	- Use of [[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] and other [[Iterative Life Cycle|iterative]] practices
	- [[Business analysis]] techniques for [[Requirements Management]]
	- Tools for identifying complex elements in projects
	- Organizational [[Change Management]] methods to prepare for transitioning the project outputs into the organization
# [[Tailoring]] Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Project Life Cycle]] | - What is an appropriate [[Project Life Cycle]]?<br>- What phases should comprise the [[Project Life Cycle]]? |
| Development life cycle | - What development life cycle and [[Development Approach]] is appropriate for the [[Products, Services, Results]]?<br>- Is a [[Predictive Life Cycle\|Predictive]] or [[Adaptive Life Cycle\|Adaptive]] approach appropriate?<br>- If [[Adaptive Life Cycle\|Adaptive]], should the [[Product]] be developed [[Incremental Life Cycle\|incrementally]] or [[Iterative Life Cycle\|iteratively]]?<br>- Is a [[Hybrid Life Cycle\|hybrid]] approach best? |
| Management approaches | - What management processes are most effective based on the [[Culture]] and the complexity? |
| [[Knowledge Management]]  | - How will [[Knowledge]] be managed to foster a collaborative working environment? |
| Change | - How will change be managed? |
| Governance | - What control boards, committees, and other [[Stakeholders]] are part of the [[Project]]?<br>- What are the project status [[reporting requirement]]s? |
| [[Lessons Learned]] | - What [[Information]] should be collected throughout and at the end of the project?<br>- How will [[Historical Information]] and [[Lessons Learned]] be made available to [[future projects]]? |
| Benefits | - When and how should [[Benefit]]s be reported: at the end of the [[Project]] or at the end of each [[iteration]] or [[phase]]? |
# In [[Agile Life Cycle|Agile]] Environments
[[Iterative Life Cycle|Iterative]] and [[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] approaches promote the engagement of team members as local domain experts in [[4 integration management]]. The [[Team]] members determine how plans and components should integrate.

The expectations of the [[Project Manager]] as noted in the [[#Key Concepts]] do not change in an [[Agile Life Cycle|agile]] environment, but control of the detailed [[Product]] planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The [[Project Manager]]'s focus is on building a collaborative [[decision making]] environment and ensuring the team has the ability to respond to changes. This collaborative approach can be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill base rather than a narrow specialization.
