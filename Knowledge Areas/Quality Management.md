# Key Concepts
- Project Quality Management addresses the management of the project and the deliverables of the project. It applies to all projects, regardless of the nature of their deliverables. Quality measures and techniques are specific to the type of deliverables being produced by the project.
- Quality and grade are different concepts. Quality is “the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements” (ISO 9000). Grade is a category assigned to deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and team are responsible for managing trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both quality and grade.
- Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to find quality issues during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when they are found by inspection or during usage.
- Project managers may need to be familiar with sampling. Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on a continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity).
- Many projects establish tolerances and control limits for project and product measurements. Tolerances (the specified range of acceptable results) and control limits (the boundaries of common variation in a statistically stable process or process performance).
- The cost of quality (COQ) includes all costs incurred over the life of the product by investment in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to meet requirements (rework). Cost of quality is often the concern of program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.
- The most effective quality management is achieved when quality is incorporated into the planning and designing of the project and product, and when organizational culture is aware and committed to quality.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Policy compliance and auditing | - What quality policies and procedures exist in the organization?<br>- What quality tools, techniques, and templates are used in the organization? |
| Standards and regulatory compliance | - Are there any specific quality standards in the industry that need to be applied?<br>- Are there any specific governmental, legal, or regulatory constraints that need to be taken into consideration? |
| Continuous improvement | - How will quality improvement be managed in the project?<br>- Is it managed at the organizational level or at the level of each project? |
| Stakeholder engagement | Is there a collaborative environment with stakeholders and suppliers? |
