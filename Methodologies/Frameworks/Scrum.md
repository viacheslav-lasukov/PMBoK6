# Definition
A lightweight framework that helps generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the Scrum rules guide their relationships and interactions.

**Empiricism** — knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed
# Pillars
- **Transparency** — the emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work
	- Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
	- Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.
- **Inspection** — the Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.
	- Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.
- **Adaptation** — If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
	- Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.
# Values
- **Commitment** — Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- **Focus** — Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- **Opennes** — Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.
- **Respect** — Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- **Courage** — Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
# Team
### Principles
- Is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people.
- No sub-teams or hierarchies
- A cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal
- Cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint
- Self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how
- Is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.
- Is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint

# Events
Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt.

# Artifacts
Artifactы represent work or value. Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured.

| *Sprint Backlog*  | Sprint Goal + Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint + plan for delivering them. A plan by and for the Developers | Sprint Goal        | Single objective for the Sprint. It provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. It creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.<br><br>The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration. |
