# Key Concepts
- The project manager should be familiar enough with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions regarding contracts and contractual relationships. But PM is typically not authorized to sign legal agreements binding the organization; this is reserved for those who have the authority to do so. 
- Procurement involves agreements that describe the relationship between a **buyer** and a **seller**. Agreements can be simple or complex, and the procurement approach should reflect the degree of complexity. An agreement can be a contract, a service-level agreement, an understanding, a memorandum of agreement, or a purchase order.
- Agreements must comply with local, national, and international laws regarding contracts.
- The project manager should ensure that all procurements meet the specific needs of the project, while working with procurement specialists to ensure organizational policies are followed.
- The legally binding nature of an agreement means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process, often involving the legal department, to ensure that it adequately describes the products, services, or results that the seller is agreeing to provide, while being in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding procurements.
- A contract should clearly state the deliverables and results expected, including any knowledge transfer from the seller to the buyer. Anything not in the contract cannot be legally enforced. When working internationally, project managers should keep in mind the effect that culture and local law have upon contracts and their enforceability, no matter how clearly a contract is written.
- A complex project may involve multiple contracts simultaneously or in sequence. The buyer-seller relationship may exist at many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the acquiring organization.
- Agreement can be:
	- contract
	- SLA
	- understanding
	- MOA
	- purchase order
- Complex project may involve managing multiple contracts simultaneously or in sequence. In such cases, each contract life cycle may begin and end during any phase of the project life cycle.
- Seller may be:
	- contractor
	- vendor
	- service provider
	- supplier
- Buyer may be:
	- owner of the final product
	- subcontractor
	- acquiring organization
	- service requestor
	- purchaser
# Trends and Emerging Practices
- **Advances in tools**. Online tools for procurement now give the buyers a single point where procurements can be advertised and provide sellers with a single source to find procurement documents and complete them directly online. In the construction/engineering/infrastructure field, the increasing use of the building information model (BIM) in software tools has been shown to save significant amounts of time and money on projects using it. This approach can substantially reduce construction claims, thereby reducing both costs and schedule. Major companies and governments worldwide are beginning to mandate the use of BIM on large projects.
- **More advanced risk management**. An increasing trend in risk management is to write contracts that accurately allocate specific risks to those entities most capable of managing them. No contractor is capable of managing all the possible major risks on a project. The buyer will be required to accept the risks that the contractors do not have control over, such as changing corporate policies in the buying organization, changing regulatory requirements, and other risks from outside the project. Contracts may specify that risk management be performed as part of the contract.
- **Changing contracting processes**. The use of internationally recognized standard contract forms is increasing in order to reduce problems and claims during execution.
- **Logistics and supply chain management**. Long-lead items may be procured in advance of other procurement contracts to meet the planned project completion date. It is possible to begin contracting for these long-lead materials, supplies, or equipment before the final design of the end product itself is completed based on the known requirements identified in the top-level design. The management of the supply chain is an area of increasing emphasis by the contractor's project team. Not only are primary sources of supplies identified early in the project, but secondary, back-up sources are also generally identified. Many countries around the world require international contractors to purchase certain minimum percentages of material and supplies from local vendors.
- **Technology and stakeholder relations**. The progress on the project can be viewed on the Internet by all stakeholders. Video data can also be stored, allowing analysis if a claim arises.
- **Trial engagements**. Some projects will engage several candidate sellers for initial deliverables and work products on a paid basis before making the full commitment to a larger portion of the project scope. This accelerates momentum by allowing the buyer to evaluate potential partners, while simultaneously making progress on project work.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Complexity of procurement | Is there one main procurement or are there multiple procurements at different times with different sellers that add to the complexity of the procurements? |
| Physical location | Are the buyers and sellers in the same location or reasonably close or in different time zones, countries, or continents? |
| Governance and regulatory environment | - Are local laws and regulations regarding procurement activities integrated with the organization's procurement policies?<br>- How does this affect contract auditing requirements? |
| Availability of contractors | Are there available contractors who are capable of performing the work? |

# In Agile/Adaptive Environments
- Sellers may be used to extend the team. It can lead to a shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the seller share in the risk and rewards associated with a project.
- Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts. In these cases, a governing agreement such as a master services agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract.
