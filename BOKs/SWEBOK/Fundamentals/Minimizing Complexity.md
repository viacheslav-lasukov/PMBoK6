SWEBOK_KA: "[[Software Construction]]"
---
Most people are limited in their ability to hold complex structures and information in their working memories, especially over long periods of time.

Reduced complexity is achieved through emphasizing code creation that is simple and readable rather than clever. It is accomplished through making use of [[Standards in Construction]], modular design ([[Construction Design]]), and numerous other specific techniques (see [[Coding]]). It is also supported by construction-focused quality techniques ([[Construction Quality]]).
