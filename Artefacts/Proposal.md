# Description

Forms the basic [[Information]] that will be used by an evaluation body to select one or more successful [[Seller]]s.

If the [[Seller]] is going to submit a price [[Proposal]], good practice is to require that it be separate from the technical [[proposal]].

The evaluation body reviews each submitted [[Proposal]] according to the [[source selection criteria]] and selects the [[Seller]] that can best satisfy the buying [[Organization]]'s [[requirement]]s.
