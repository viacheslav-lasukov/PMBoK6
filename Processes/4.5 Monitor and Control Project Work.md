# Description
Tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the [[Project Management Plan]].
## Concerned with
- Comparing actual project performance against the [[Project Management Plan]];
- Assessing performance periodically to determine whether any corrective or preventive actions are indicated, and then recommending those actions as necessary;
- Checking the status of [[individual project risk]]s;
- Maintaining an accurate, timely [[Information]] base concerning the [[Project Outcome]]s and their associated documentation through [[Project]] completion
- Providing [[Information]] to support status reporting, progress measurement, and forecasting
- Providing forecasts to update current cost and current schedule information;
- Monitoring implementation of approved changes as they occur;
- Providing appropriate reporting on project progress and status to [[Program Management]] when the project is part of an overall program; and
- Ensuring that the project stays aligned with the [[Business Need]]s.
## Key Benefits
Allows [[Stakeholders]] to understand the current state of the [[Project]], to recognize the actions taken to address any performance [[Issue]]s, and to have visibility into the future [[Project]] status with cost and [[Schedule Forecasts]].
