# Description
For [[Individual Project Risk]]s.
## Escalate
Escalation is appropriate when the [[Team]] or the [[Sponsor]] agrees that a threat is outside the [[Project Scope]] or that the proposed response would exceed the [[Project Manager]]'s authority. Escalated [[Risk]]s are managed at the [[Program]] level, [[Portfolio]] level, or other relevant part of the [[Organization]], and not on the [[Project]] level. The [[Project Manager]] determines who should be notified about the [[threat]] and communicates the details to that person or part of the [[Organization]]. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the [[Organization]]. [[Threat]]s are usually escalated to the level that matches the [[Objective]]s that would be affected if the [[threat]] occurred. Escalated [[threat]]s are not monitored further by the [[Team]] after escalation, although they may be recorded in the [[Risk Register]] for information.
## Avoid
[[Team]] acts to eliminate the [[threat]] or protect the [[Project]] from its **impact**. It may be appropriate for high-priority [[threat]]s with a high **probability** of occurrence and a large negative **impact**. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the [[project management plan]] or changing the [[Objective]] that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the [[threat]] entirely, reducing its **probability** of occurrence to zero. The [[Risk Owner]] may also take action to isolate the [[Objective]]s from the [[Risk]]'s impact if it were to occur. 
### Examples
- removing the cause of a threat
- extending the schedule
- changing the strategy
- reducing [[Project Scope]]
- clarifying [[Requirement]]s
- obtaining information
- improving communication
- acquiring expertise
## Transfer
Involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. [[Agreement]] may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party.
### Examples
- use of insurance
- performance bonds
- warranties
- guarantees
## Mitigate
Action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or **impact** of a [[threat]]. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the [[threat]] has occurred. Mitigation may involve prototype development to reduce the [[Risk]] of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a #pmbok6/process or [[Product]].

Response might reduce the **impact** by targeting factors that drive the severity, e.g., designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.
### Examples
- adopting less complex processes
- conducting more tests
- choosing a more stable [[Seller]]
## Accept
Acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. May be appropriate for low- priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. 
### Can Be
- **Active**. Establish a [[Contingency Reserves]], including amounts of time, money, or [[Resource]]s to handle the threat if it occurs.
- **Passive**. Involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly.
