# Description
The component of the [[Project Management Plan]].

Provides guidance on how project resources should be categorized, allocated, managed, and released.

May be divided between the [[Team Management Plan]] and [[Physical Resource Management Plan]] according to the specifics of the [[project]].
## Includes
- **Identification of resources**. Methods for identifying and quantifying team and physical resources needed.
- **Acquiring resources**. Guidance on how to acquire team and physical resources for the project.
- **[[Roles and responsibilities]]**:
	- **Role**. The function assumed by, or assigned to, a person in the project. Examples: civil engineer, [[Business Analyst]], [[Testing Coordinator]].
	- **Authority**. The rights to apply project resources, make decisions, sign approvals, accept deliverables, and influence others to carry out the work of the project. Examples: the selection of a method for completing an activity, quality acceptance criteria, and how to respond to project variances. [[Team member]]s operate best when their individual levels of authority match their individual responsibilities.
