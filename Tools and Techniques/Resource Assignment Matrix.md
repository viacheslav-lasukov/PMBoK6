# Description
Shows the project [[Resource]]s assigned to each [[Work Package]].

Is used to illustrate the connections between [[Work Package]]s, or activities, and [[Team]] members.

The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity. This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has [[Authority]] for the work.
## Can be developed at various levels
- high-level [[Resource Assignment Matrix|RAM]] can define the responsibilities of a [[Team]], group, or unit within each component of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]
- lower-level [[Resource Assignment Matrix|RAM]]s are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of [[Authority]] for specific activities.
## Examples
