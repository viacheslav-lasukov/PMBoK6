# Description
## #pmbok6 
Documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for the authorization of further [[Disciplines/Project Management]] activities. 

Lists the objectives and reasons for [[Initiating|Initiation]].

Helps measure the [[Success Measures|Success]] at the end of the [[Project]] against the [[Objective]]s. Is used throughout the [[Project Life Cycle]]. May be used before the [[Initiating|Initiation]] and may result in a go/no-go decision.
## #ba 
A justification for a course of action based on the benefits to be realized by using the proposed solution, as compared to the cost, effort, and other considerations to acquire and live with that solution.
# Structure
## [[Business Need]]s
- Determination of what is prompting the need for action;
- Situational statement documenting the business problem or opportunity to be addressed including the value to be delivered to the organization;
- Identification of stakeholders affected;
- Identification of the scope.
## Analysis of the Situation
- Identification of [[Organizational Strategy|Organizational Strategies]], goals, and [[Objective]]s;
- Identification of root cause(s) of the problem or main contributors of an [[opportunity]];
- [[Gap Analysis]]
- Identification of known risks; Identification of critical success factors;
- Identification of decision [[Criteria]] by which the various courses of action may be assessed;
     Examples of [[Criteria]] categories used for analysis of a situation are:
	- ***Required***. This is a criterion that is ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
	- ***Desired***. This is a criterion that is ‚Äúdesired‚Äù to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
	- ***Optional***. This is a criterion that is not essential. Fulfillment of this criterion may become a differentiator between alternative courses of action.
- Identification of a set of options to be considered for addressing the business problem or opportunity. Options are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Options may also be described as business scenarios. For example, a business case could present the following three options:
	- ***Do nothing***. This is also referred to as the ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù option. Selection of this option results in the [[Project]] not being authorized.
	- ***Do the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity***. The minimum may be established by identifying the set of documented [[Criteria]] that are key in addressing the problem or opportunity.
	- ***Do more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity***. This option meets the minimum set of [[Criteria]] and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of these options documented in the business case.
## Recommendation
- A statement of the recommended option to pursue in the [[Project]]
- Items to include in the statement may include but are not limited to:
	- Analysis results for the potential option
	- Constraints, [[Assumption Log|Assumptions]], [[Risk]]s, and dependencies for the potential options
	- [[Success Measures]]
- An implementation approach that may include but is not limited to:
	- [[Milestone List|Milestones]]
	- [[Project Dependencies]]
	- [[Roles and Responsibilities]]
## Evaluation
- Statement describing the plan for measuring benefits the [[Project]] will deliver. This should include any ongoing [[Operation]]al aspects of the recommended option beyond initial implementation.
