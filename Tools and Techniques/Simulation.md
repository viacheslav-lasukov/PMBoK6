# Description
Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving [[project objectives]].

Most common simulation technique ‚Äî [[Monte Carlo]] analysis, in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate possible schedule outcomes for the total project.

Involves calculating multiple [[Work Package]] durations with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions and other [[Representations of Uncertainty]].
## Example
Probability distribution for a project with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a 10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability of completing the project by May 28.
