# Description
Tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan.
## Concerned with
- Comparing actual project performance against the project management plan;
- Assessing performance periodically to determine whether any corrective or preventive actions are indicated, and then recommending those actions as necessary;
- Checking the status of individual project risks;
- Maintaining an accurate, timely information base concerning the project's product(s) and their associated documentation through project completion;
- Providing information to support status reporting, progress measurement, and forecasting;
- Providing forecasts to update current cost and current schedule information;
- Monitoring implementation of approved changes as they occur;
- Providing appropriate reporting on project progress and status to program management when the project is part of an overall program; and
- Ensuring that the project stays aligned with the business needs.
## Key Benefits
Allows stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, to recognize the actions taken to address any performance issues, and to have visibility into the future project status with cost and schedule forecasts.
