# Description
Involves comparing actual or planned [[project]] practices or the [[quality standards]] to those of comparable [[project]]s to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance.

Benchmarked [[project]]s may exist within the [[performing organization]] or outside of it, or can be within the same application area or other application area.

Allows for analogies from [[project]]s in a different application area or different industries to be made.
