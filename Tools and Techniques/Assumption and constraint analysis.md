Description: "[[Assumption and Constraint Analysis#Description|üìù]]"
---
# Description
Every [[project]] and its [[project management plan]] are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints.

These are often already incorporated in the [[scope baseline]] and project estimates.

[[Assumption and Constraint Analysis]] explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project.

Threats may be identified from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions.

Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.
