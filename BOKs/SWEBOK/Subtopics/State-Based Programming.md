Uses [[finite state machine]]s to describe program behaviours.

The transition graphs of a [[finite state machine]] are used in all stages of software development (specification, implementation, debugging, and documentation).

The main idea is to construct computer programs the same way the automation of technological processes is done.

Is usually combined with [[object-oriented programming]], forming a new composite approach called ***state-based, object-oriented programming***.
