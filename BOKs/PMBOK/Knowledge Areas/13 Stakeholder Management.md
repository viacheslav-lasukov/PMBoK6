# Key Concepts
- Every project has stakeholders who are impacted by or can impact the project in a positive or negative way.
- Some stakeholders will have a limited ability to influence the project's work or outcomes; others will have significant influence on the project and its expected outcomes.
- The ability of the project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all of the stakeholders in an appropriate way can mean the difference between project success and failure.
- To increase the chances of success, the process of stakeholder identification and engagement should commence as soon as possible after the project charter has been approved, the project manager has been assigned, and the team begins to form.
- The key to effective stakeholder engagement is a focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders. Stakeholder satisfaction should be identified and managed as a key project objective.
- The process of identifying and engaging stakeholders for the benefit of the project is iterative, and should be reviewed and updated routinely, particularly when:
	- The project moves through different phases in its life cycle
	- Current stakeholders are no longer involved in the work of the project or new stakeholders become members of the project's [[Stakeholder Community]]
	- There are significant changes in the organization or the wider [[Stakeholder Community]]

# Trends and Emerging Practices
- Identifying all stakeholders, not just a limited set
- Ensuring that all team members are involved in stakeholder engagement activities
- Reviewing the [[Stakeholder Community]] regularly, often in parallel with reviews of [[Individual Project Risk]]s
- Consulting with stakeholders who are most affected by the work or outcomes of the project through the concept of co-creation. Co-creation places greater emphasis on including affected stakeholders in the team as partners
- Capturing the value of effective stakeholder engagement, both **positive** and **negative**:
	- **Positive** value can be based on the consideration of benefits derived from higher levels of active support from stakeholders, particularly powerful stakeholders.
	- **Negative** value can be derived by measuring the true costs of not engaging stakeholders effectively, leading to [[Product]] recalls or loss of organizational or project reputation
# [[Tailoring]] Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Stakeholder diversity | - How many stakeholders are there?<br>- How diverse is the culture within the [[Stakeholder Community]]? |
| Complexity of stakeholder relationships | How complex are the relationships within the [[Stakeholder Community]]?<br>The more networks a stakeholder or stakeholder group participates in, the more complex the networks of [[Information]] and misinformation the stakeholder may receive. |
| Communication technology | - What communication technology is available?<br>- What support mechanisms are in place to ensure that best value is achieved from the technology? |

# In [[Agile Life Cycle|Agile]] Environments
- To facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making, adaptive teams engage with stakeholders directly rather than going through layers of management.
- Client, user, and developer exchange [[Information]] in a dynamic co-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction.
- Regular interactions with the [[Stakeholder Community]] throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of success for the project.
- The intent of inviting any stakeholders to project meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public spaces is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment, dependency, or other [[Issue]] related to the changing project.
