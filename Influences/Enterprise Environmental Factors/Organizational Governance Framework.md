**Governance** — organizational or structural arrangements at all levels of an [[organization]] designed to determine and influence the behavior of the [[organization]]'s members.
Governance:
- Is multidimensional
- Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies
- Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback
# Governance Framework
Framework within which [[Authority]] is exercised in [[organization]]s.
###### Includes:
- Rules
- Policies
- Procedures
- Norms
- Relationships
- Systems
- Processes
###### Influences How:
- Objectives of the [[organization]] are set and achieved
- Risk is monitored and assessed
- Performance is optimized
# Governance of [[Portfolio]]s, [[Program]]s, and [[Project]]s
###### Governance Domains
- alignment
- risk
- performance
- communications
###### Each Domain Has the Following Functions
- oversight
- control
- integration
- [[decision making]]
Each **function** has **governance supporting processes and activities** for stand-alone [[project]]s, or [[project]]ss operating within the [[portfolio]] or [[program]] environments.

**Project governance** — the framework, functions, and processes that guide [[project management]] activities in order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. There is no one governance framework that is effective in all organizations. A governance framework should be tailored to the organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization in order to be effective.
