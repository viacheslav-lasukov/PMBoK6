# Description
Gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes.

Driven from [[Work Performance Data]]. To become [[Work Perfomance Information]], the work performance data are compared with the [[Project Management Plan]] components, project documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing.

| Knowledge Area | Description |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [[5 Scope Management]] | Includes correlated and contextualized information on how the [[project scope]] and [[product scope]] are performing compared to the [[Scope Baseline]]:<br>- about [[Deliverables]]<br>	- which [[Deliverables]] have been accepted<br>	- which have not been accepted<br>	- the reasons why<br>- about changes<br>	- categories of the changes received<br>	- identified scope variances and their causes<br>	- how they impact schedule or cost<br>	- forecast of the future scope performance |  |
| [[6 Schedule Management]] | Includes information on how the project work is performing compared to the [[schedule baseline]].<br><br>Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be calculated at the [[work package]] level and control account level.<br><br>For projects using [[earned value analysis]], the (SV) and (SPI) are documented for inclusion in [[work performance report]]s. |  |
| [[7 Cost Management]] | Includes information on how the project work is performing compared to the [[cost baseline]].<br><br>Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at the [[work package]] level and control account level.<br><br>For projects using [[earned value analysis]], CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and [[To-Complete Performance Index\|TCPI]] are documented for inclusion in [[work performance report]]s. |  |
| [[8 Quality Management]] | Includes:<br>- information on project requirements fulfillment<br>- causes for rejections<br>- rework required<br>- recommendations for corrective actions<br>- lists of verified deliverables<br>- status of the quality metrics<br>- the need for process adjustments |  |
