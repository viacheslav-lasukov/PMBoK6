Description: "[[Control Chart#Description|üìù]]"
Section: 8.3.2.5
---
A graphic display of #pmbok6/process [[Data]] over time and against established [[Control Limit]]s, which has a centerline that assists in detecting a trend of plotted values toward either [[Control Limit]].

Upper and lower [[Specification]] limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. Upper and lower [[Control Limit]]s are different from [[Specification]] limits. The [[Control Limit]]s are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability for a stable process.

The [[Project Manager]] and appropriate [[Stakeholders]] may use the statistically calculated [[Control Limit]]s to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains outside the [[Control Limit]]s.
## Is Used to
- determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable performance
- monitor various types of output variables
- track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots
- monitor cost and [[Schedule Variance]]s, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results to help determine if the project management processes are in control
