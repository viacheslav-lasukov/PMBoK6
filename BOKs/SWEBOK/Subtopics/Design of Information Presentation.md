- Keep information presentation separate from the information itself
- Response time
- Indication of progress
- Feedback on user's input
- Color management:
	- Limit the number of colors used
	- Use color change to show the change of software status
	- Use color-coding to support the user’s task
	- Use color-coding in a thoughtful and consistent way
	- Use colors to facilitate access for people with color blindness or color deficiency (e.g., use the change of color saturation and color brightness, try to avoid blue and red combinations)
	- Don’t depend on color alone to convey important information to users with different capabilities (blindness, poor eyesight, colorblindness, etc.)
