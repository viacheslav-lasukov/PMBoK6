# Description
Provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months) based on the [[product roadmap]] and the [[Product Vision]] for the product's evolution.

Determines the number of [[iteration]]s or sprints in the release, and allows the [[Product Owner]] and team to decide how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals, dependencies, and impediments.

Since features represent value to the [[Customer]], the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule as it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the [[Customer]] is looking for.
