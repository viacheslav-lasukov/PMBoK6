As part of the [[4.6 Perform Integrated Change Control]] process, a [[Change Log]] update indicates that some changes are approved and some are not.

[[Change requests]] are processed according to the [[change management plan]] by the [[Roles/Project Manager]], [[Change Control Board|CCB]], or an assigned [[Team]] member.

As a result, changes may be approved, deferred, or rejected.

[[Approved change requests]] will be implemented through the [[4.3 Direct and Manage Project Work]] [[process]].

Deferred or rejected [[change requests]] are communicated to the person or group requesting the change.

The disposition of all [[change requests]] are recorded in the [[Change Log]] as a #project-document s update.

The [[Project]] should have the capability of identifying, communicating, and resolving changes that impact the work of multiple [[Seller]]s. |  |
