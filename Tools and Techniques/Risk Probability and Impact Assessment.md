# Description
Considers the likelihood that a specific risk will occur.

Considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule, cost, [[Quality]], or performance.

Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities.

Probability and impact are assessed for each identified [[Individual Project Risk]].

Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the [[Risk Register]].

[[Team]] members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included.

The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the [[Interviews]] or meeting.

Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences should be explored.

Explanatory detail, including [[Assumption]]s justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded.

Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the [[risk management plan]].

Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the [[Risk Register]] as part of a watch list for future monitoring.
