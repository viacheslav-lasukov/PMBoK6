# Description
An output of a [[Schedule Model]] that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and [[Resource]]s.

At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned [[Start Date]] and planned [[Finish Date]] for each activity. If [[Resource]] planning is done at an early stage, the [[project schedule]] remains preliminary until [[Resource]] assignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and [[Finish Date]]s are established. This process usually occurs no later than the completion of the [[project management plan]].

A target [[Schedule Model]] may also be developed with a defined target start and target finish for each [[activity]].

May be presented in summary form, sometimes referred to as the [[Master Schedule]] or [[Milestone Schedule]], or presented in detail.
## Formats
* **[[Bar Chart]]s** ([[Gantt Chart]]). Represent schedule [[Information]] where activities are listed on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal bars placed according to start and [[Finish Date]]s. Float can be depicted or not. For [[Control]] and management communications, the broader, more comprehensive [[Summary Activity]] is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports.
* **[[Milestone List|Milestones]] Charts**. similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of major [[deliverables]] and key external interfaces.
* **[[Schedule Network Diagram]]**. Usually shows both the project network logic and the [[Critical Path]] [[Schedule Activity|Schedule Activities]]. This example also shows how each [[Work Package]] is planned as a series of related [[Activity|activities]]. Possible presentations:
	* "activity-on-node" diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, aka "pure logic diagram"
	* "time-scaled schedule network" diagram format aka "logic bar chart"
	* "time-scaled logic" diagram showing a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. Optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the same line of the diagram in sequence
