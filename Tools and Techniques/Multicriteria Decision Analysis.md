# Description
Uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.

Can be used to identify the key issues and suitable alternatives to be prioritized as a set of decisions for implementation.

Criteria are prioritized and weighted before being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives are then ranked by score.
## Dimensions
| Dimension | Example |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Project** decisions | Choosing among different implementation scenarios or suppliers. |
| **[[Product]]** decisions | Evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction, and risks associated with resolving [[Product]] defects. |
## Criterias
### Resources
- **Availability**. Verify that the [[Resource]] is available to work on the project within the time period needed.
- **Cost**. Verify if the cost of adding the [[Resource]] is within the prescribed budget.
- **Ability**. Verify that the team member provides the capability needed by the project.
- **Experience**. Verify that the team member has the [[relevant experience]] that will contribute to the project success.
- **Knowledge**. Consider if the team member has relevant [[Knowledge]] of the [[Customer]], similar implemented projects, and nuances of the [[Environment]].
