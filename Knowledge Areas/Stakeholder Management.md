# Key Concepts
- Every project has stakeholders who are impacted by or can impact the project in a positive or negative way. Some stakeholders will have a limited ability to influence the project's work or outcomes; others will have significant influence on the project and its expected outcomes.
- The ability of the project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all of the stakeholders in an appropriate way can mean the difference between project success and failure.
- To increase the chances of success, the process of stakeholder identification and engagement should commence as soon as possible after the project charter has been approved, the project manager has been assigned, and the team begins to form.
- The key to effective stakeholder engagement is a focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders. Stakeholder satisfaction should be identified and managed as a key project objective.
- The process of identifying and engaging stakeholders for the benefit of the project is iterative, and should be reviewed and updated routinely, particularly when the project moves into a new phase, or if there are significant changes in the organization or the wider stakeholder community.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Stakeholder diversity | - How many stakeholders are there?<br>- How diverse is the culture within the stakeholder community? |
| Complexity of stakeholder relationships | How complex are the relationships within the stakeholder community?<br>The more networks a stakeholder or stakeholder group participates in, the more complex the networks of information and misinformation the stakeholder may receive. |
| Communication technology | - What communication technology is available?<br>- What support mechanisms are in place to ensure that best value is achieved from the technology? |
