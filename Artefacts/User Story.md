Short, highlevel descriptions of required functionality expressed in customer terms: *“As a **role**, I want **goal/desire** so that **benefit**”*

Is intended to contain just enough information so that the [[Developer]]s can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it.

The aim is to avoid some of the waste that often happens in projects where detailed requirements are gathered early but become invalid before the work begins.

Before a [[user story]] is implemented, an appropriate [[Acceptance Criteria|acceptance]] procedure must be written by the customer to determine whether the [[Goal]]s of the [[user story]] have been fulfilled.
