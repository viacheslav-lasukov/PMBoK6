# Description
[[Schedule Compression]] technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings.

May result in [[Rework]] and increased risk.

Only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the [[Critical Path]].

Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned and increases quality risk.

May also increase project costs.
