# Description
Estimating the [[duration]] or cost of an [[activity]] or a [[Project]] using [[Historical Information]] from a similar [[activity]] or [[Similar Projects]].

Uses parameters from a previous, [[Similar Projects]], such as [[duration]], [[budget]], size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a [[future projects]].

Is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other #tool-technique s, but it is also less accurate.
