# Description
Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective information about the quality of the product or service under test in accordance with the project requirements.

The intent of testing is to find errors, defects, bugs, or other nonconformance problems in the product or service.

The type, amount, and extent of tests needed to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time, budget, and other constraints.

Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the [[project]] become available, and at the end of the [[project]] on the final [[deliverables]].

Early testing helps identify nonconformance problems and helps reduce the cost of fixing the nonconforming components.
