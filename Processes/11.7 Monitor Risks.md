# Description
Monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans, tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.

Uses performance information generated during project execution to determine if:
- Implemented [[risk responses]] are effective
- Level of [[overall project risk]] has changed
- Status of identified [[individual risk]]s has changed
- New [[individual risk]]s have arisen,
- [[11 Risk Management|Risk Management]] approach is still appropriate
- Project assumptions are still valid
- [[11 Risk Management|Risk Management]] policies and procedures are being followed
- [[Contingency reserves]] for cost or schedule require modification
- [[Project strategy]] is still valid
## Key Benefits
Enables project decisions to be based on current information about overall project risk exposure and individual project risks.
