- Software Design Reviews — informal and formalized techniques to determine the quality of design artifacts (for example, architecture reviews, design reviews, and inspections; scenario-based techniques; requirements tracing). Software design reviews can also evaluate security. Aids for installation, operation, and usage (for example, manuals and help files) can be reviewed.
- Static Analysis — formal or semiformal static (nonexecutable) analysis that can be used to evaluate a design (for example, faulttree analysis or automated cross-checking). Design vulnerability analysis (for example, static analysis for security weaknesses) can be performed if security is a concern. Formal design analysis uses mathematical models that allow designers to predicate the behavior and validate the performance of the software instead of having to rely entirely on testing. Formal design analysis can be used to detect residual specification and design errors (perhaps caused by imprecision, ambiguity, and sometimes other kinds of mistakes). (See also the [[Software Engineering Models and Methods]] #swebok/ka.)
- Simulation and [[Prototypes|Prototyping]] — dynamic techniques to evaluate a design (for example, performance simulation or feasibility prototypes
