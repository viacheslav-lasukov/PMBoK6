Captures details of identified [[Individual Project Risk]]s.
## Consists of
* **List of identified risks** ‚Äî Identified risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).
* **Potential [[Risk Owner]]s** ‚Äî Where a potential [[Risk Owner]] has been identified during the [[11.2 Identify Risks]] process, the [[Risk Owner]] is recorded in the [[risk register]]. This will be confirmed during the [[11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis]] process.
* **List of potential risk responses** ‚Äî Where a potential risk response has been identified during the [[11.2 Identify Risks]] process, it is recorded in the [[risk register]]. This will be confirmed during the [[11.5 Plan Risk Responses]] process.
* **Short title**
* **Category**
* **Current status**
* **Causes**
* **Effects on objectives**
* **Triggers** ‚Äî Events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur.
* **[[Work Breakdown Structure]] reference** of affected activities
* **Timing information**
	* When was the risk identified
	* When might the risk occur
	* When might it no longer be relevant
	* What is the deadline for taking action 
* Agreed-upon response strategies
* Specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy
* Trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk occurrence
* [[Budget]] and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses
* Contingency plans and risk triggers that call for their execution
* [[Fallback Plan]]s for use when a [[Risk]] that has occurred and the primary [[Risk Responses]] prove to be inadequate
* Residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that have been deliberately accepted
* [[Secondary Risk]]s that arise as a direct outcome of [[11.6 Implement Risk Responses]]
