# Description
Hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk.

Helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which [[individual project risk]]s may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. The organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS.
## Example
