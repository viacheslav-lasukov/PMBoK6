# Description
Are used to .

Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from specification limits. The control limits are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability for a stable process.

The [[project manager]] and appropriate [[stakeholders]] may use the statistically calculated control limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains outside the control limits.
## Is Used to
- determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable performance
- monitor various types of output variables
- track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots
- monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results to help determine if the project management processes are in control
