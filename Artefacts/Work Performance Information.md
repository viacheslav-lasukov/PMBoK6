# Description
Gathered through work [[Executing|execution]] and passed to the [[Monitoring and Controlling]] processes.

Driven from [[Work Performance Data]]. To become [[Work Performance Information]], the [[work performance data]] are compared with the [[Project Management Plan]] components, project documents, and other project variables.

This comparison indicates how the project is performing.

| Knowledge Area | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[5 Scope Management]] | Includes correlated and contextualized information on how the [[project scope]] and [[product scope]] are performing compared to the [[Scope Baseline]]:<br>- about [[Deliverables]]<br>	- which [[Deliverables]] have been accepted<br>	- which have not been accepted<br>	- the reasons why<br>- about changes<br>	- categories of the changes received<br>	- identified scope variances and their causes<br>	- how they impact schedule or cost<br>	- forecast of the future scope performance |
| [[6 Schedule Management]] | Information on how the project work is performing compared to the [[schedule baseline]].<br><br>Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be calculated at the [[work package]] level and control account level.<br><br>For projects using [[earned value analysis]], the (SV) and (SPI) are documented for inclusion in [[work performance report]]s. |
| [[7 Cost Management]] | Includes information on how the project work is performing compared to the [[cost baseline]].<br><br>Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at the [[work package]] level and control account level.<br><br>For projects using [[earned value analysis]], CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and [[To-Complete Performance Index\|TCPI]] are documented for inclusion in [[work performance report]]s. |
| [[8 Quality Management]] | Includes:<br>- information on project requirements fulfillment<br>- causes for rejections<br>- rework required<br>- recommendations for corrective actions<br>- lists of verified deliverables<br>- status of the quality metrics<br>- the need for process adjustments |
| [[9 Resource Management]] | Information on how the [[project]] work is progressing by comparing [[resource requirements]] and resource allocation to resource utilization across the [[project activities]].<br><br>This comparison can show gaps in resource availability that need to be addressed. |
| [[10 Communications Management]] | Includes:<br>- information on how project communication is performing by comparing the communications that were implemented compared to those that were planned<br>- feedback on communications, such as [[Questionnaires and Surveys\|survey]] results on communication effectiveness |
| [[11 Risk Management]] | - Includes information on how project [[11 Risk Management\|Risk Management]] is performing by comparing the [[individual risk]] that have occurred with the expectation of how they would occur.<br>- Indicates the effectiveness of the [[11.5 Plan Risk Responses\|Response Planning]] and [[11.6 Implement Risk Responses\|Response Implementation]] processes. |
| [[12 Procurement Management]] | Information on how a [[seller]] is performing by comparing the [[deliverables]] received, the technical performance achieved, and the costs incurred and accepted against the [[Statement of Work\|SOW]] budget for the work performed. |
