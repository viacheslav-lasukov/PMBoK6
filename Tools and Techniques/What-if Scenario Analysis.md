# Description
The process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict their effect, positive or negative, on [[project objectives]]. This is an analysis of the question, "*What if the situation represented by scenario X happens?*"

A [[Schedule Network Analysis]] is performed using the schedule to compute the different scenarios:
- delaying a major component delivery
- extending specific engineering durations
- introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process

The outcome can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.
