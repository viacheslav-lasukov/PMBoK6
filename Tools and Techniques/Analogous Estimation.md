# Description
Estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project.

Uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project.

Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also less accurate.
