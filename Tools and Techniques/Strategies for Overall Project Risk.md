# Description

| Strategy | Description | Examples |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Avoid | Where the level of [[Overall Project Risk]] is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon [[risk threshold]]s, an avoid strategy may be adopted. Involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty as a whole and bring the [[Project]] back within the thresholds. Where it is not possible to bring the [[Project]] back within the thresholds, the [[Project]] may be canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable. | - removal of high-risk elements of the [[Project Scope]] |
| Exploit | Where the level of [[Overall Project Risk]] is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. Involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty as a whole. Risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity. | - addition of high-benefit elements of the [[Project Scope]] to add value or benefits to [[Stakeholders]] |
| Transfer/share | If the level of [[Overall Project Risk]] is high but the [[Organization]] is unable to address it effectively, a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the [[Organization]]. Where [[Overall Project Risk]] is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive [[Overall Project Risk]], ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits.  | - setting up a collaborative business structure in which the [[Buyer]] and the [[Seller]] share the [[Overall Project Risk]]<br>- launching a joint venture or special-purpose company<br>- subcontracting key elements of the project |
| Mitigate/enhance | Involves changing the level of [[Overall Project Risk]] to optimize the chances of achieving the [[Objective]]s. Is used where [[Overall Project Risk]] is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive. | - replanning the project<br>- changing the [[Project Scope]] and boundaries<br>- modifying project priority<br>- changing [[Resource]] allocations<br>- adjusting delivery times |
| Accept | Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address [[Overall Project Risk]], the [[Organization]] may choose to continue as currently defined, even if [[Overall Project Risk]] is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. | - **Active**. establish an overall [[Contingency Reserves]], including amounts of time, money, or [[Resource]]s to be used if the [project] exceeds its thresholds.<br>- **Passive**. involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of [[Overall Project Risk]] to ensure that it does not change significantly. |
