Can be used to define products and services. Includes asking questions about a [[Products, Services, Results]] and forming answers to describe the use, characteristics, and other relevant aspects of what is going to be delivered.

Each application area has one or more generally accepted methods for translating high-level [[Products, Services, Results]] descriptions into meaningful [[deliverables]].

[[Requirement]]s are captured at a high level and decomposed to the level of detail needed to design the final [[Product]].
## Examples
- [[Product]] breakdown
- [[Requirements Analysis and Design]]
- [[Systems analysis]]
- [[Systems Engineering]]
- [[Value]] analysis
