# Description
Includes correlated and contextualized information on how the [[project scope]] and [[product scope]] are performing compared to the [[Scope Baseline]]:
- about [[Deliverables]]
	- which [[Deliverables]] have been accepted
	- which have not been accepted
	- the reasons why
- about changes
	- categories of the changes received
	- identified scope variances and their causes
	- how they impact schedule or cost
	- forecast of the future scope performance

Gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes.

Driven from [[Work Performance Data]]. To become [[Work Perfomance Information]], the work performance data are compared with the [[Project Management Plan]] components, project documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing.
