- **Question-answer**. The interaction is essentially restricted to a single question-answer exchange between the user and the software. The user issues a question to the software, and the software returns the answer to the question.
- **Direct manipulation**. Users interact with objects on the computer screen. Direct manipulation often includes a pointing device (such as a mouse, trackball, or a finger on touch screens) that manipulates an object and invokes actions that specify what is to be done with that object.
- **Menu selection**. The user selects a command from a menu list of commands.
- **Form fill-in**. The user fills in the fields of a form. Sometimes fields include menus, in which case the form has action buttons for the user to initiate action. â€¢ Command language. The user issues a command and provides related parameters to direct the software what to do.
- **Natural language**. The user issues a command in natural language. That is, the natural language is a front end to a command language and is parsed and translated into software commands.
