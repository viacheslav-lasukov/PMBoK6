# Description
Are not updated as part of the project work. Processes, policies, and procedures are usually established by the [[Project Management Office]] or another function outside of the project. These can be updated only by following the appropriate organizational policies associated with updating processes, policies, or procedures. Some organizations encourage the team to tailor templates, life cycles, and checklists for the project. In these instances, the project management team should tailor those assets to meet the needs of the project.
