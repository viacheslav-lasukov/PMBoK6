The process of designing a [[software]] application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without major engineering change.

Should accommodate string and character-set issues including:
- which character set is to be used
- what kinds of strings are used
- how to maintain the strings without changing the code
- translating the strings into different languages with minimal impact on:
	- the processing code
	- the user interface (see [[User Interface Design]] #swebok/topic)
