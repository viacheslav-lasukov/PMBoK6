# Key Concepts
- Project scheduling provides a detailed plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the products, services, and results defined in the project scope.
- The project schedule is used as a tool for communication, managing stakeholder expectations, and a basis for performance reporting.
- When possible, the detailed project schedule should remain flexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge gained, increased understanding of the risk, and value-added activities.

# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Life cycle approach | - What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a detailed schedule? |
| Duration and resource | - What are the factors influencing durations, such as the correlation between resource availability and productivity? |
| Project dimensions | - How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty, pace or progress tracking, (such as earned value management, percentage complete, red-yellow- green (stop light) indicators) impact the desired level of control? |
| Technology support | - Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model information and is it readily accessible? |
