# Description
## Components
- **Prevention costs**. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, [[deliverables]], or services of the specific project.
- **Appraisal costs**. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the products, [[deliverables]], or services of the specific project.
- **Failure costs (internal/external)**. Costs related to nonconformance of the products, [[deliverables]], or services to the needs or expectations of the stakeholders.
The optimal COQ is one that reflects the appropriate balance for investing in the cost of prevention and appraisal to avoid failure costs.
