Is the practice of modifying correct code in ways that make it run more efficiently.

Improves performance at the code level.

Involves only small-scale changes that affect a single class, a single routine, or, more commonly, a few lines of code.

Techniques for tuning:
- logic expressions
- loops
- data transformations
- expressions
- routines

Using a low-level language is another common technique for improving some hot spots in a program.
