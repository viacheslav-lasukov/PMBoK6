# Description
The project team may consider other characteristics of risk (in addition to [[Risk Probability and Impact Assessment|probability and impact]]) when prioritizing [[Individual Project Risk]]s for further analysis and action.

Consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible by only [[Risk Probability and Impact Assessment]].

| Characteristic | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Urgency | Period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective. A short period indicates high urgency. |
| Proximity | Period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. A short period indicates high proximity. |
| Dormancy | Period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. A short period indicates low dormancy. |
| Manageability | Ease with which the [[Risk Owner]] (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or impact of a risk. Where management is easy, manageability is high. |
| Controllability | Degree to which the [[Risk Owner]] (or owning organization) is able to [[Control]] the risk's outcome. Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high. |
| Detectability | Ease with which the results of the risk occurring, or being about to occur, can be detected and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high. |
| Connectivity | Extent to which the risk is related to other [[Individual Project Risk]]s. Where a risk is connected to many other risks, connectivity is high. |
| Strategic impact | Potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization's strategic goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high. |
| Propinquity | Degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is perceived as very significant, propinquity is high. |
