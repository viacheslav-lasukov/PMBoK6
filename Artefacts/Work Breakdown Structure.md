# Description
Hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the [[project objectives]] and create the required [[Deliverables]]. Each descending level of the WBS represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.
## Example
![[Sample WBS Decomposed Down Through Work Packages.png]]
## Structuring Ways
- Using **phases** of the project life cycle as the 2nd level of decomposition, with the product and project deliverables inserted at the 3rd level
  ![[WBS Organized by Phase.png]]
- Using **major deliverables** as the second level of decomposition

- Incorporating **subcomponents** that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as contracted work. The [[seller]] then develops the supporting [[Agreement|contract]] WBS as part of the contracted work
