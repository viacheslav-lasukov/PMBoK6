# Description
Presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with summary information on identified individual project risks.
## Result of [[11.2 Identify Risks]]
- **Sources of overall project risk**, indicating which are the most important drivers of overall project risk exposure
- **Summary information on identified individual project risks**, such as number of identified threats and opportunities, distribution of risks across risk categories, metrics and trends, etc.
## Result of [[11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis]]
- most important project risks (with the highest probability and impact)
- prioritized list of all identified risks on the project and a summary conclusion
## Result of [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis]]
- Assessment of overall project risk exposure. Overall project risk is reflected in two key measures:
	1. Chances of project success, indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives (e.g., required end date or interim milestones, required cost target, etc.) given the identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty; and
	2. Degree of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted, indicated by the range of possible project outcomes.
- Detailed probabilistic analysis of the project. Key outputs from the [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis]] are presented, such as S-curves, tornado diagrams, and criticality analysis, together with a narrative interpretation of the results. Possible detailed results of a [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis]] may include:s
	- Amount of contingency reserve needed to provide a specified level of confidence;
	- Identification of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty that have the greatest effect on the project critical path; and
	- Major drivers of overall project risk, with the greatest influence on uncertainty in project outcomes.
- Prioritized list of individual project risks. This list includes those individual project risks that pose the greatest threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project, as indicated by sensitivity analysis.
- Trends in quantitative risk analysis results. As the analysis is repeated at different times during the project life cycle, trends may become apparent that inform the planning of risk responses.
- Recommended risk responses. The risk report may present suggested responses to the level of overall project risk exposure or key individual project risks, based on the results of the [[11.4 Perform Quantitative risk analysis|Quantitative Risk Analysis]]. These recommendations will form inputs to the [[11.5 Plan Risk Responses]] process.
