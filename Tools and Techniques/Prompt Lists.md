# Description
A predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk.

Can be used as a framework to aid the [[project team]] in idea generation when using [[11.2 Identify Risks|Risks Identification]] techniques.

The risk categories in the lowest level of the [[risk breakdown structure]] can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks.

Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk:
- PESTLE ‚Äî political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental
- TECOP ‚Äî technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political
- VUCA ‚Äî volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity
