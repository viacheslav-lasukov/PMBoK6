# Description
One of the [[Procurement Documentation]].

In choosing evaluation criteria, the [[Buyer]] seeks to ensure that the [[Proposal]] selected will offer the best [[Quality]] for the services required.
## Includes
- Capability and capacity
- [[Product]] cost and life cycle cost
- Delivery dates
- Technical expertise and approach
- Specific [[relevant experience]]
- Adequacy of the proposed approach and work plan in responding to the [[Statement of Work|SOW]]
- Key staff's qualifications, availability, and competence
- Financial stability of the firm
- Management experience 
- Suitability of the [[Knowledge Transfer]]  program, including training

For international projects, evaluation [[Criteria]] may include “local content” requirements, for example, participation by nationals among proposed key staff.

The specific [[Criteria]] may be a numerical score, color-code, or a written description of how well the [[Seller]] satisfies the buying organization's needs.

The [[Criteria]] will be part of a weighting system that can be used to select a single [[Seller]] that will be asked to sign a [[Agreement|contract]] and establish a negotiating sequence by ranking all the proposals by the weighted evaluation scores assigned to each [[Proposal]].
