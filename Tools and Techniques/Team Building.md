# Description
Conducting activities that enhance the [[Team]]'s social relations and build a collaborative and cooperative working environment.

Activities can vary from a 5-minute agenda item in a [[Status Meeting]] to an offsite, professionally facilitated event designed to improve interpersonal relationships.

The objective of team-building activities is to help individual [[Team]] members work together effectively.

Strategies are particularly valuable when [[Team]] members operate from remote locations without the benefit of face-to-face contact.

Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing good working relationships.

While [[team building]] is essential during the initial stages, it should be a continuous process.

Changes in a [[Environment]] are inevitable, and to manage them effectively, a continuous or renewed team-building effort may be applied.

The [[Roles/Project Manager]] should continually monitor team functionality and performance to determine if any actions are needed to prevent or correct various team problems.
