# Description
The component of the [[Project Management Plan]].

Describes how the project costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan.
## Establishes
- **Units of measure**. Each unit used in measurements is defined for each of the [[Resource]]s. Examples:
	- staff hours, staff days
	- weeks for time measures
	- meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures
	- lump sum in currency form
- **Level of precision**. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to US$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project.
- **Level of accuracy**. The acceptable range (e.g., Â±10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified, and may include an amount for contingencies.
- **Organizational procedures links**. The [[Work Breakdown Structure]] provides the framework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and [[Control]] of costs. The [[Work Breakdown Structure]] component used for the project cost accounting is called the [[control account]]. Each [[control account]] is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the [[Performing Organization]]'s accounting system.
- **Control thresholds**. [[Variance]] thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate an agreed-upon amount of [[Variation]] to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan.
- **Rules of performance measurement**. [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the cost management plan may:
	- Define the points in the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] at which measurement of [[Control Account]] s will be performed;
	- Establish the [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixed-formula, [[Percent Complete]], etc.) to be employed; and
	- Specify tracking methodologies and the [[Earned Value Analysis|EVA]] computation equations for calculating projected [[Estimate]] at completion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottom-up EAC.
- **Reporting formats**. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined.
- **Additional details**. Additional details about [[7 Cost Management]] activities include but are not limited to:
	- Description of strategic funding choices
	- Procedure to account for fluctuations in [[Currency Exchange Rates and Inflation]]
	- Procedure for project cost recording
