All costs incurred over the life of the [[Product]] by investment in preventing nonconformance to [[Requirement]]s, appraisal of the [[Products, Services, Results]] for [[Conformance]] to [[Requirement]]s, and failure to meet [[Requirement]]s.

The optimal COQ is one that reflects the appropriate balance for investing in the cost of prevention and appraisal to avoid failure costs.
## Components
- **Prevention costs**. Costs related to the prevention of poor [[Quality]] in the [[Product]]s, [[deliverables]], or services of the specific [[Project]]
- **Appraisal costs**. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the [[Product]]s, [[deliverables]], or services of the specific [[Project]]
- **Failure costs (internal/external)**. Costs related to nonconformance of the [[Product]]s, [[deliverables]], or services to the needs or expectations of the [[Stakeholders]]
