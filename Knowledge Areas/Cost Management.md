# Key Concepts
- Project Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities, but it should also consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using, maintaining, and supporting project deliverables.
- Different stakeholders will measure project costs in different ways and at different times. Stakeholder requirements for managing costs should be considered explicitly.
- Predicting and analyzing the prospective financial performance of the project's product may be performed outside the project, or it may be part of Project Cost Management.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Knowledge management | Does the organization have a formal knowledge management and financial databases repository that a project manager is required to use and is readily accessible? |
| Estimating and budgeting | Does the organization have existing formal or informal cost estimating and budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines? |
| Earned value management | Does the organization use earned value management in managing projects? |
| Use of agile approach | Does the organization use agile methodologies in managing projects? How does this impact cost estimating? |
| Governance | Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures, and guidelines? |
