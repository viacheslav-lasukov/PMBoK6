# Description
The component of the [[Project Management Plan]].

The approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any [[Management Reserves]], which can only be changed through formal [[Change Control]].

It is used as a basis for comparison to actual results.

The [[cost baseline]] is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.
