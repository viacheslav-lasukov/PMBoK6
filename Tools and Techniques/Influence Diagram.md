# Description
Graphical aids to [[Decision Making]] under uncertainty.

Represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and influences, together with the relationships and effects between them.

Where an element in the influence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of [[Individual Project Risk]]s or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the influence diagram using ranges or probability distributions.

The influence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as [[Monte Carlo Simulation]] analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence on key outcomes.

Outputs from an influence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, including S-curves and [[Tornado Diagram]]s.
