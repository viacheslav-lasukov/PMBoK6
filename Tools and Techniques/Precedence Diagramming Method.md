# Description
Constructing a [[Schedule Model]] in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which the activities are to be performed.

Precedence Relationship ‚Äî a logical dependency between activities.
## Types of Relationships/Dependencies
| Name | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Finish-to-start** (FS) | [[Successor Activity]] cannot start until a [[Predecessor Activity]] has finished. | Installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware is assembled (predecessor). |
| **Finish-to-finish** (FF) | [[Successor Activity]] cannot finish until a [[Predecessor Activity]] has finished. | Writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document (successor) can finish. |
| **Start-to-start** (SS) | [[Successor Activity]] cannot start until a [[Predecessor Activity]] has started. | Level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. |
| **Start-to-finish** (SF) | [[Successor Activity]] cannot finish until a [[Predecessor Activity]] has started. | A new [[Accounts Payable System]] (successor) has to start before the old [[Accounts Payable System]] can be shut down (predecessor). |
- **FS** is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship.
- **SF** relationship is very rarely used, but is included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.
- Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, **SS** and **FF**).
- Multiple relationships between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the highest impact.
- Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.
