# Description
Prepared by a [[Seller|seller]] in response to a [[Procurement Documentation|Procurement Documents]] package.

Forms the basic information that will be used by an evaluation body to select one or more successful [[seller]]s.

If the [[seller]] is going to submit a price [[proposal]], good practice is to require that it be separate from the technical proposal.

The evaluation body reviews each submitted [[proposal]] according to the [[source selection criteria]] and selects the [[seller]] that can best satisfy the buying [[organization]]'s requirements.
