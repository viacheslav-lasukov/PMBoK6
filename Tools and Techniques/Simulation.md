Simulation models the combined effects of [[Individual Project Risk]]s and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving [[Objective]]s.

Most common simulation technique â€” [[Monte Carlo Simulation]] analysis, in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate possible schedule outcomes for the total project.

Involves calculating multiple [[Work Package]] durations with different sets of activity [[Assumption]]s, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions and other [[Representations of Uncertainty]].
## Example
Probability distribution for a project with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project [[Finish Date]]). In this example, there is a 10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability of completing the project by May 28.
