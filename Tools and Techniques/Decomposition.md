# Description
Dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. The level of **decomposition** is often guided by the degree of control needed to effectively manage the project. The level of detail for [[Work Package]]s will vary with the size and complexity of the project. Different [[Deliverables]] can have different levels of **decomposition**. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and control the work is enhanced. Excessive **decomposition** can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefficient use of resources, decreased efficiency in performing the work, and difficulty aggregating data over different levels of the [[Work Breakdown Structure]].
## Involves Activities
- Identifying and analyzing the [[Deliverables]] and related work
- Structuring and organizing the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]
- Decomposing the upper [[Work Breakdown Structure]] levels into lower-level detailed components
- Developing and assigning identification codes to the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] components
- Verifying that the degree of **decomposition** of the deliverables is appropriate
