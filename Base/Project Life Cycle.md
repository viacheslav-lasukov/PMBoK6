## Tailoring Recommendations
| Situation | Tailoring Recommendation |
| ---- | ---- |
| Very large project teams | Restructure large projects as multiple smaller projects. Try a technology trial project first and then an implementation project.<br><br>Consider more frequent releases of fewer features each, which allows for the creation of smaller project teams. Consider reducing the team down to its critical core members. Often too many people hinder a process, not help it. Reducing a team size can reduce churn as well as costs.<br><br>Break large teams into multiple smaller teams and use program management to synchronize and coordinate. Use agile and lean program management to organize the<br><br>Use [[Agile Life Cycle\|agile]] and [[Lean]] [[Program Management]] to organize the larger [[effort]]. Consider a scaled [[Agile Life Cycle\|agile]] or [[Lean]] [[framework]] such as [[Disciplined Agile\|DA]], [[Scaled Agile Framework\|SAFe]], or [[Large Scale Scrum\|LeSS]]. Each offers some useful ideas, and each carries implementation [[risk]]s and process weight/cost. |
| Dispersed teams | Many projects have (some) dispersed team members.Tools like instant messaging, video conferencing, and electronic team boards help bridge many of the communication gaps.<br><br>When teams are likely to remain stable, set up face-to-face meetings as soon as possible to make future remote conversations more effective. People who have met face-to- face are more likely to enter unfiltered debate because of higher trust.<br><br>When conducting meetings with remote participants where there is a loss of facial and body-language cues, consider round-robin check-ins to ensure participation and check consensus for decisions.<br><br>Also, consider the use of iteration-based agile approaches. When team members are many time zones apart, consider using whole-project interactions less frequently, while encouraging more personal meetings (two or three people at a time) more frequently. |
| Some safety critical products mayrequire additional documentation andconformance checks beyond whatagile processes suggest out-of-the-box | Agile approaches can still be used in these environments, but they need to have the appropriate additional layers of conformance review, documentation, and certi­cation that is required by the domain. In that case, documentation could be part of what the team delivers along with ­nished features. Features may not be done until the documentation is completed.<br><br>Consider using a hybrid approach (multiple agile approaches) to get the bene­ts of improved collaboration and communication brought by agile with the added rigor required by the product environment. Aircraftight system developers and drug companies use agile approaches coupled with their own additional processes to leverage the bene­ts and retain appropriate controls. |
| Stable requirements and execution process | Is agile really needed? If uncertainty in [[requirement]]s is low, low rates of change, or minimal execution risk, the full suite of agile approaches may not be needed. While any project bene­ts from increased collaboration and transparency; some of the iterative build and review cycles might be overkill.<br><br>If build/feedback cycles do not routinely uncover or re­ne requirements, consider extending their durations to minimize the cost impact of review time.<br><br>If the [[project]] has high rates of [[Change]] during design and development, but rolling it out to customers is a de­ned and repeatable process, hybrid approaches that use the appropriate [[Project Life Cycle\|life cycle]] model for each [[phase]] may make more sense. |
| Teams are in functional silos inside functional organizations | Agile is built on the idea of cross-functional teams. Consider asking people to create cross-functional teams themselves, without management involvement and see what happens.<br><br>If the compensation system is organized to recognize and reward functional areas, consider changing that ­rst. People might not act in the interest of the product or the team until it affects their compensation in some way. |
| Transparency can cause fear | Agile creates a culture of transparency: people show and share their work throughout development. This sharing of interim deliverables and being open and honest about successes, failures, and current state is transparency. Transparency requires courage.<br><br>Lead by example and demonstrate transparency in decision-making processes by using a status board or whiteboard. |
| Many of the team members have little technical domain knowledge | Agile approaches encourage and make use of self-directing teams to make local decisions about work items, such as task sequencing and which approach to use when solving a problem. When the majority of team members are inexperienced, consensus-based approaches may lead to problems and rework. So, for these teams, additional help “assigning” and “directing” may be necessary until the team gains the necessary skills. In other words, do not just declare that agile will be used and let an inexperienced team try to gure everything out because they are empowered and self-directing. Consider building centers of competencies to help provide guidance and build domain knowledge. |
| Lack of executive buy-in | When executive buy-in is missing, teams will encounter a clash between the agile mindset and approaches and the more predictive mindset and approaches.<br><br>Find common ground, areas for improvement based on the organization’s needs, and then use experiments and retrospectives to progress.<br><br>Consider education/[[training]] for executives. Consider explaining agile in terms of [[lean thinking]]: short cycles, small batch sizes, frequent reviews, and [[retrospective]]s with small improvements. |
| Agile terms and language do not fit the organizational culture | Modify the terms so people will understand and agree to the activities, if not the agile language. Be specic about what each term means.<br><br>For example, if the organization finds the word “game” unprofessional, don’t use terms such as “planning game.” Instead, consider using the term “planning workshop.” |
