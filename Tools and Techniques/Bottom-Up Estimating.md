Estimating [[Duration]] or cost by aggregating the [[Estimate]]s of the lower-level [[Work Breakdown Structure Component|WBS Component]]s.

When an activity's duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence, the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These [[Estimate]]s are then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity's durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies between them that can affect the application and use of [[Resource]]s. If there are dependencies, this pattern of [[Resource]] usage is reflected and documented in the estimated [[Requirement]]s of the activity.
