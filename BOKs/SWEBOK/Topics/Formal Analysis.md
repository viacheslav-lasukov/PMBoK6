Formal expression of [[requirement]]s requires a language with formally defined semantics.
## Benefits
- enables [[requirement]]s expressed in the language to be specified precisely and unambiguously, thus (in principle) avoiding the potential for misinterpretation
- [[requirement]]s can be reasoned over, permitting desired properties of the specified [[Phenomenons/Software]] to be proven
