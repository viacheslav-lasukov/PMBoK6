# Key Concepts
- The project manager should be familiar enough with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions regarding contracts and contractual relationships.
- Procurement involves agreements that describe the relationship between a buyer and a seller. Agreements can be simple or complex, and the procurement approach should reflect the degree of complexity. An agreement can be a contract, a service-level agreement, an understanding, a memorandum of agreement, or a purchase order.
- Agreements must comply with local, national, and international laws regarding contracts.
- The project manager should ensure that all procurements meet the specific needs of the project, while working with procurement specialists to ensure organizational policies are followed.
- The legally binding nature of an agreement means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process, often involving the legal department, to ensure that it adequately describes the products, services, or results that the seller is agreeing to provide, while being in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding procurements.
- A complex project may involve multiple contracts simultaneously or in sequence. The buyer-seller relationship may exist at many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the acquiring organization.
# Tailoring Considerations
| Aspect | Useful Questions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Complexity of procurement | Is there one main procurement or are there multiple procurements at different times with different sellers that add to the complexity of the procurements? |
| Physical location | Are the buyers and sellers in the same location or reasonably close or in different time zones, countries, or continents? |
| Governance and regulatory environment | - Are local laws and regulations regarding procurement activities integrated with the organization's procurement policies?<br>- How does this affect contract auditing requirements? |
| Availability of contractors | Are there available contractors who are capable of performing the work? |
